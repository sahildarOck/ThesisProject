Honor the configuration parameter core.logAllRefUpdates when writing
reflogs.  Instead of writing reflog entries always only write
reflogs if this parameter is set to true or if the corresponding
file in the <git-dir>/logs directory already exists. In other words:
if you are updating a ref and this parameter is set to false and
there is no file corresponding to your ref in the <git-dir>/logs
folder then no reflog will be written.

This is a horribly simple HTTP server which provides only the
server side support required for dumb transport clients.  We
produce the info/refs and objects/info/packs file on the fly
from the local repository state, but otherwise serve data as
raw files from disk.

We could better optimize the Sender class and those that use
it to take advantage of direct file to network APIs in more
advanced servlet containers like Jetty.  This is left for a
future improvement to the code.

Drop our simple and stupid jgit.sh and instead rely upon Maven
for the command line based build.  Maven is relatively simple to
download and install, and doesn't require the entire Eclipse IDE.

To avoid too much refactoring of the current code we reuse the
existing src/ directory within each plugin, and treat each of
the existing OSGI bundles as one Maven artifact.

The command line wrapper jgit.sh no longer works in the uncompiled
state, as we don't know where to obtain our JSch or args4j from.
Developers will now need to compile it with `mvn package`, or run
our Main class from within an IDE which has the proper classpath.

We can now use `tools/version.sh --release` to update the MANIFEST.MF
and Maven POM files with the current version number of this project,
so they appear in any build product created.

The counterpart --snapshot option be used to reset files to use
their natural *-SNAPSHOT and *.qualifier state during development.

We use a simple Bourne shell script with Perl calls because we
must edit both Maven pom.xml and OSGi bundle MANIFEST.MF in order
to store the correct data for our parallel build systems.  In the
future we should use a native Java solution which relies upon JGit
to compute the `git describe` portion.

Until we tag our first official release a ""tagged snapshot"" can be
made by creating an artifical annotated tag first:

  git tag -a -m ""initial contribution"" v0.5.1 046198cf5f21e5a63e8ec0ecde2ef3fe21db2eae
  tools/version.sh --release

Resulting in a version string like ""0.5.1.50-ge16af83"".

Later we are going to add support for smart HTTP, which requires us to
buffer at least some of the request created by a client before we ship
it to the server.  For many requests, we can fit it completely into a
1 MiB buffer, but if it doesn't we can drop back to using the chunked
transfer encoding to send an unknown stream length.

Rather than recoding the block based memory buffer, we refactor the
local file overflow strategy into a subclass, allowing the HTTP client
code to replace this portion of the logic with its own approach to
start the chunked encoding request.

JUnit tests fail under Tycho's manifest-first build, because I
don't know why.

Rather than maintain OSGi bundle data by hand, use the same plugin
that Jetty is using to produce their OSGi bundles.

We're still compatible-enough with Eclipse to allow importing these
projects using the m2eclipse plugin as standard Maven projects, but
the PDE will think they are vaild plugins and make them available
for plugin builds, or test executions in the workbench.

A nice side-effect is we can continue to run with Maven 2.x, and
not require the 3.0 alpha builds needed to run Tycho.

A not-so-nice side-effect is our JSch dependency version number
is not embedded correctly into the bundle's MANIFEST.MF, which
means we could pick up any random version of JSch from our runtime
environment.  That's not the most stable way to execute.

This commit actually does two major changes to the way references
are handled within JGit.  Unfortunately they were easier to do as
a single commit.

Disambiguate symbolic references:
---------------------------------

  Reporting a symbolic reference such as HEAD as though it were
  any other normal reference like refs/heads/master causes subtle
  programming errors.  We have been bitten by this error on several
  occasions, as have some downstream applications written by myself.

  Instead of reporting HEAD as a reference whose name differs from
  its ""original name"", report it as an actual SymbolicRef object
  that the application can test the type and examine the target of.

  With this change, Ref is now an abstract type with different
  subclasses for the different types.

  In the classical example of ""HEAD"" being a symbolic reference to
  branch ""refs/heads/master"", the Repository.getAllRefs() method
  will now return:

      Map<String, Ref> all = repository.getAllRefs();
      SymbolicRef HEAD = (SymbolicRef) all.get(""HEAD"");
      ObjectIdRef master = (ObjectIdRef) all.get(""refs/heads/master"");

      assertSame(master,               HEAD.getTarget());
      assertSame(master.getObjectId(), HEAD.getObjectId());

      assertEquals(""HEAD"",              HEAD.getName());
      assertEquals(""refs/heads/master"", master.getName());

  A nice side-effect of this change is the storage type of the
  symbolic reference is no longer ambiguous with the storge type
  of the underlying reference it targets.  In the above example,
  if master was only available in the packed-refs file, then the
  following is also true:

      assertEquals(Ref.Storage.LOOSE,  HEAD.getStorage());
      assertEquals(Ref.Storage.PACKED, master.getStorage());

  (Prior to this change we returned the ambiguous storage of
   LOOSE_PACKED for HEAD, which was confusing since it wasn't
   actually true on disk).

  Another nice side-effect of this change is all intermediate
  symbolic references are preserved, and are therefore visible
  to the application when they walk the target chain.  We can
  now correctly inspect chains of symbolic references.

  As a result of this change the Ref.getOrigName() method has been
  removed from the API.  Applications should identify a symbolic
  reference by testing for instanceof SymbolicRef and not by using
  an arcane string comparsion between properties.

Abstract the RefDatabase storage:
---------------------------------

  RefDatabase is now abstract, similar to ObjectDatabase, and a
  new concrete implementation called RefDirectory is used for the
  traditional on-disk storage layout.  In the future we plan to
  support additional implementations, such as a pure in-memory
  RefDatabase for unit testing purposes.

  The implementation of the in-memory reference cache, reading, and
  update routines has been completely rewritten.  Most of the code
  was heavily borrowed or cribbed from the prior implementation,
  so copyright notices have been left intact as much as possible.

  The RefDirectory cache no longer confuses symoblic references
  with normal references.  This permits the cache to resolve the
  value of a symbolic reference as late as possible, ensuring it
  is always current, without needing to maintain reverse pointers.

  The cache is now a single map (rather than 3), reducing the
  in-memory footprint and improving access times by reducing the
  number of map operations required per-reference read or updated.

  The RefLogWriter class has been fully folded into RefDirectory
  and is therefore deleted.  Maintaining the reference's log is
  the responsiblity of the database implementation, and not all
  implementations will use java.io for access.  Future work still
  remains to be done to abstract the ReflogReader class away from
  local disk IO.

By using RefUpdate for symbolic reference creation we can reuse
the logic related to updating the reflog with the event, without
needing to expose something such as the legacy ReflogWriter class
(which we no longer have).

Applications using writeSymref must update their code to use the
new pattern of changing the reference through the updateRef method:

    String refName = ""refs/heads/master"";
    RefUpdate u = repository.updateRef(Constants.HEAD);
    u.setRefLogMessage(""checkout: moving to "" + refName, false);
    switch (u.link(refName)) {
    case NEW:
    case FORCED:
    case NO_CHANGE:
        // A successful update of the reference
        break;
    default:
        // Handle the failure, e.g. for older behavior
        throw new IOException(u.getResult());
    }

These types can be used by RefDatabase implementations to manage
the collection.

A RefList stores items sorted by their name, and is an immutable
type using copy-on-write semantics to perform modifications to
the collection.  Binary search is used to locate an existing item
by name, or to locate the proper insertion position if an item does
not exist.

A RefMap can merge up to 3 RefList collections at once during its
entry iteration, allowing items in the resolved or loose RefList
to override items by the same name in the packed RefList.

The RefMap's goal is O(log N) lookup time, and O(N) iteration time,
which is suitable for returning from a RefDatabase.  By relying on
the immutable RefList we might be able to make map construction
nearly constant, making Repository.getAllRefs() an inexpensive
operation if the caches are current.  Since modification is not
common, changes require up to O(N + log N) time to copy the internal
list and collapse or expand the list's array.  As most changes
are made to the loose collection and not the packed collection,
in practice most changes would require less than the full O(N)
time, due to a significantly smaller N in the loose list.

Almost complete test coverage is included in the corresponding
unit tests.  A handful of methods on RefMap are not tested in this
change, as writing the proper test depends on a future refactoring

Don't copy and sort the set of references if they are passed through
in a RefMap or a SortedMap using the key's natural sort ordering.
Either map is already in the order we want to present the items
to the client in, so copying and sorting is a waste of local CPU
and memory.

Annotated tags created with C Git versions before the introduction
of c818566 ([PATCH] Update tags to record who made them, 2005-07-14),
do not have a ""tagger"" line present in the object header.  This line
did not appear in C Git until v0.99.1~9.

Ancient projects such as the Linux kernel contain such tags, for
example Linux 2.6.12 is older than when this feature first appeared
in C Git.  Linux v2.6.13-rc4 in late July 2005 is the first kernel
version tag to actually contain a tagger line.

It is therefore acceptable for the header to be missing, and for
the RevTag.getTaggerIdent() method to return null.

Since the Javadoc for getTaggerIdent() already explained that the
identity may be null, we just need to test that this is true when
the header is missing, and allow the ObjectChecker to pass anyway.

Config was confusing the following two variables when writing the

When parsed, we say that my.empty has 1 value, null, and my.enabled
is an empty string value that in boolean context should be evaluated
as true.

Saving this configuration file back to text format was ignoring the
null value for my.empty, producing a completely different file than
what Config read:

  [my]
    empty
    enabled

Instead handle the writing differently to ensure the original format
is output.  New tests cases cover the expected behavior and return
values from accessor methods.

A record also must not have a stage outside of the standard 0-3

Any other values would be truncated into this space, storing a

A 0 file mode in a DirCacheEntry is not a valid mode.  To C git
such a value indicates the record should not be present.  We already
were catching this bad state and exceptioning out when writing tree
objects to disk, but we did not fail when writing the dircache back
to disk.  This allowed JGit applications to create a dircache file
which C git would not like to read.

Instead of checking the mode during writes, we now check during
mutation.  This allows application bugs to be detected sooner and
closer to the cause site.  It also allows us to avoid checking most
of the records which we read in from disk, as we can assume these
are formatted correctly.

Some of our unit tests were not setting the FileMode on their test
entry, so they had to be updated to use REGULAR_FILE.

already valid, since its originating from the destination index.

very low-cost object since it has only the 4 byte length buffer.

Any messages received on side band #2 that aren't scraped as a
progress message into our ProgressMonitor are now forwarded to a
buffer which is later included into the OperationResult object.
Application callers can use this buffer to present the additional
messages from the remote peer after the push or fetch operation
has concluded.

The smart push connections using the native send-pack/receive-pack
protocol now request side-band-64k capability if it is available
and forward any messages received through that channel onto this
message buffer.  This makes hook messages available over smart HTTP,
or even over SSH.

The SSH transport was modified to redirect the remote command's
stderr stream into the message buffer, interleaved with any data
received over side band #2.  Due to buffering between these two
different channels in the SSH channel mux itself the order of any
writes between the two cannot be ensured, but it tries to stay close.

To keep things simple, the application has to wait for the entire
operation to complete before it can see the messages.  This may
be a downside if the user is trying to debug a remote hook that is
blocking indefinitely, the user would need to abort the connection
before they can inspect the message buffer in any sort of UI built
on top of JGit.

JSch will allow us to close the connection and then just drop
any late messages coming over the stderr stream for the command.
This makes it easy to lose final output on a command, like from
Gerrit Code Review's post receive hook.

Instead spawn a background thread to copy data from JSch's pipe
into our own buffer, and wait for that thread to receive EOF on the
pipe before we declare the connection closed. This way we don't
have a race condition between the stderr data arriving and JSch
just tearing down the channel.

GitHub broke the native git protocol a while ago by interjecting an
""ERR message"" line into the upload-pack or receive-pack advertisement
list.  This didn't match the expected pattern, so it caused existing
C Git clients to abort with a protocol exception.

These days, C Git clients actually look for this message and abort
with a more graceful notice to the end-user.  JGit should do the
same, including setting up a custom exception type that makes it
easier for higher-level UIs to identify a message from the remote
site and present it to the user.

The script merges explicit copyright statements in all Java sources with author
information from git history, updates the copyright headers accordingly and
updates the license headers to EDL. For recognized copyright formats see the
test data in tools/fixHeaders-TestData.txt.

To fix the headers for all revisions run (caution: don't do that if
you don't understand the implications of rewriting history):

git filter-branch --tree-filter 'fixHeaders.pl' HEAD

There is no mapping from author information in git history to explicit
copyright headers yet which might be different. There is also no normalization
honoring .mailmap.

E.g. author ""Joe Developer <joe.dev@greatcorp.com>"" might have added an
explicit copyright header of his company ""Copyright (c) 2010, GreatCorp Inc.""
to a file he committed a change for. The script will then list copyright
headers for both.

This proved to be a pretty difficult to find bug.  If we read exactly
the number of response bytes from the UnionInputStream and didn't
try to read beyond that length, the last connection's InputStream is
still inside of the UnionInputStream, and UnionInputStream.isEmpty()
returns false.  But there is no data present, so the next read
request to our UnionInputStream returns EOF at a point where the
HTTP client code should have started a new request in order to get
more data.

Instead of wrapping the UnionInputStream, push an dummy stream onto
the end of it which when invoked always starts the next request and
then returns EOF.  The UnionInputStream will automatically pop that
dummy stream out, and then read the next request's stream.

This way we never get into the state where we don't think we need
to run another request in order to satisfy the current read request,
but we really do.

The bug was hidden for so long because BasePackConnection.init()
was always wrapping the InputStream into a BufferedInputStream
with an 8 KiB buffer.  This made the odds of us reading from the
UnionInputStream the exact number of available bytes quite low, as
the BufferedInputStream would always try to read a full buffer size.

Some transports actually provide stream buffering on their own,
without needing to be wrapped up inside of a BufferedInputStream in
order to smooth out system calls to read or write.  A great example
of this is the JSch SSH client, or the Apache MINA SSHD server.
Both use custom buffering to packetize the streams into the encrypted
SSH channel, and wrapping them up inside of a BufferedInputStream
or BufferedOutputStream is relatively pointless.

Our SideBandOutputStream implementation also provides some fairly
large buffering, equal to one complete side-band packet on the main
data channel.  Wrapping that inside of a BufferedOutputStream just to
smooth out small writes from PackWriter causes extra data copies, and
provides no advantage.  We can save some memory and some CPU cycles
by letting PackWriter dump directly into the SideBandOutputStream's
internal buffer array.

Instead we push the buffering streams down to be as close to the
network socket (or operating system pipe) as possible.  This allows
us to smooth out the smaller reads/writes from pkt-line messages
during advertisement and negotation, but avoid copying altogether
when the stream switches to larger writes over a side band channel.

The HTTP server side code now uses the same approach that the smart
HTTP client code uses when preparing a request body.  The payload
is streamed into a TemporaryBuffer of limited size.  If the entire
data fits, its compressed with gzip if the user agent supports that,
and a Content-Length header is used to transmit the fixed length
body to the peer.  If however the data overflows the limited memory
segment, its streamed uncompressed to the peer.

One might initially think that larger contents which overflow
the buffer should also be compressed, rather than sent raw, since
they were deemed ""large"".  But usually these larger contents are
actually a pack file which has been already heavily compressed by
Git specific routines.  Trying to deflate that with gzip is probably
going to take up more space, not less, so the compression overhead
isn't worthwhile.

This buffer and compress optimization helps repositories with a
large number of references, as their text based advertisements
compress well. For example jgit's own native repository currently
requires 32,628 bytes for its full advertisement of 489 references.
Most repositories have fewer references, and thus could compress
their entire response in one buffer.

When reading pkt-lines off an InputStream we are quite likely to
consume a whole group of fairly short lines in rapid succession, such
as in the have exchange that occurs in the fetch-pack/upload-pack
protocol.  Rather than allocating a throwaway buffer for each
line's raw byte sequence, reuse a buffer that is equal to the small
side-band packet size, which is 1000 bytes.  Text based pkt-lines
are required to be less than this size because many widely deployed
versions of C Git use a statically allocated array of this length.

When listing branches, EGit only reads the advertisement and then
disconnects.  When it closes down the pack channel the remote side is
waiting for the client to send our list of commands, or a flush-pkt to
let it know there is nothing to do.

However if an error thread is open watching the SSH stderr stream, we
ask for it to finish before we send the flush-pkt.  Unfortunately the
thread won't terminate until the main output stream closes, which is
waiting for the flush-pkt.  A classic network deadlock.

If the output stream needs a flush-pkt we send it before we wait for
the error stream to close.  If the flush-pkt is rejected, we close
down the output stream early, assuming that the remote side is broken
and we will get error information soon.

If we need to append less than 20 bytes in order to fix a thin pack
and make it complete, we need to set the length of our file back to
the actual number of bytes used because the original SHA-1 footer was
not completely overwritten.  That extra data will confuse the header
and footer fixup logic when it tries to read to the end of the file.

This isn't a very common case to occur, which is why we've never
seen it before.  Getting a delta that requires a whole object which
uses less than 20 bytes in pack representation is really hard.
Generally a delta generator won't make these, because the delta
would be bigger than simply deflating the whole object.  I only
managed to do this with a hand-crafted pack file where a 1 byte
delta was pointed to a 1 byte whole object.

Normally we try really hard to avoid truncating, because its
typically not safe across network filesystems.  But the odds of
this occurring are very low.  This truncation is done on a file
we have open for writing, will append more content onto, and is
a temporary file that we won't move into position for others to
see until we've validated its SHA-1 is sane.  I don't think the
truncate on NFS issue is something we need to worry about here.

The only current consumer of these collections is ReceivePack,
where it needs to test ObjectId equality between a RevObject and an
ObjectId.  There we were copying from a traditional HashSet<ObjectId>
into an ObjectIdSubclassMap<ObjectId>, as the latter can perform
hashing using ObjectId's native value support, bypassing RevObject's
override on hashCode() and equals().  Instead of doing that copy,
directly create ObjectIdSubclassMap instances inside of ReceivePack.

We also only need to record the objects that do not appear in the
incoming pack, and were therefore copied from the local repositiory
in order to complete delta resolution.  Instead of listing everything
that used an OBJ_REF_DELTA format, list only the objects that we
pulled from the destination repository via a normal ObjectLoader.

ReceivePack can now discard the IndexPack object, and all of its
other data, as soon as these collections are held by the check
connectivity method.  This frees up memory for the ObjectWalk's
own RevObject pool.

This API is intendet to be used by external components when
functionalities of the standard git commands are required. It will also
help to ease writing JGit tests.

For internal usages this API may often not be optimal because the git
commands are doing much more than required or they expect parameters of
an unappropriate type.

If a corrupt loose object is read, UnpackedObjectLoader was disposing
of the Inflater, and then attempting to return the disposed Inflater
to the InflaterCache.  Since the disposed Inflater had its native
libz resource deallocated and its reference cleared out, the Inflater
threw NullPointerException and refused to reset itself before being
put back into the cache.

Instead of disposing of the Inflater when corruption is found, do
nothing, and allow it to be returned to the cache.  The instance
will get reset, and should be usable by a future caller.

Additionally, the TranslationBundle.getEffectiveLocale method

There is a potential race condition during insertPack that can lead
to us having the same pack file open twice in the same directory.

A different thread can miss an object on disk, and trigger a scan
of the directory, and notice the pack that was put in by IndexPack.
So the pack winds up in the newly created PackList.

The IndexPack thread then wakes up and finishes its insertPack by
creating a new PackFile and inserting it into position 0 of the list.
We now have the same pack listed twice.

Readers will favor the earlier PackFile instance, because its the
first one they come across as they iterate through the list.

Keep that earlier one when we scan the pack directory again, as
this will avoid needing to purge out all of the windows that may
have been cached.

Of course we should also fix that race condition, but this block
was taking the wrong resolution if this error ever shows up, so
lets first fix the block to use a more sane resolution.

If a concurrent thread picks up a newly created PackFile and adds
it to the pack list before the IndexPack thread itself can insert
the item onto the front of the list, do nothing and use the item
that was picked up by that other concurrent scanning thread.

This avoids a potential condition where the same pack exists in
memory twice, which causes confusion later during a rescan of the
directory because we don't know exactly which PackFile instance
should be retained into the new list, and which should be discarded.

We can stop searching through the old pack list as soon as the
sort function declares that the item to insert should be before
the item already in the list.  Because the list is always sorted
by modification time (in seconds), we should never encounter a
case where the pack is positioned at the wrong spot in the list.
This early break out still permits an efficient implementation of
the common case, inserting a new pack at the head of the list.

The repository state tells in which state the repo is and also which actions
are currently allowed. The state MERGING is telling that a commit is not
possible. But this is only true in the case of unmerged paths in the index.
When we are merging but have resolved all conflicts then we are in a special
state: We are still merging (means the next commit should have multiple
parents) but a commit is now allowed.

Since the MERGING state ""canCommit()"" cannot be enhanced to return true/false
based on the index state (MERGING is a enum value which does not have a
reference to the repo it's state is representing) I had to introduce a new
state MERGING_RESOLVED. This new state will report that a commit is possible.

CAUTION: there might be the chance that users of jgit previously blindly did a
plain commit (a one with one parent) when the RepositoryState allowed them to
do. With this change these users will now be confronted with a RepositoryState
which tells a commit is possible but before they can commit they'll have to
check the MERGE_MESSAGE and MERGE_HEAD files and use the info from these
files.

When we read the object header we copy 20 bytes from the pack data,
then start parsing out the type and the inflated size.  For most
objects, this is only going to require 3 bytes, which is sufficient
to represent objects with inflated sizes of up to 2^16.  The local
buffer however still has 17 bytes remaining in it, and that can be
used to satisfy the OBJ_OFS_DELTA header.

We shouldn't need to worry about walking off the end of the buffer
here, because delta offsets cannot be larger than 64 bits, and that
requires only 9 bytes in the OFS_DELTA encoding.

Assuming worst-case scenarios of 9 bytes for the OFS_DELTA encoding,
the pack file itself must be approaching 2^64 bytes, an infeasible
size to store on any current technology.  However, even if this
were the case we still have 11 bytes for the type/size header.
In that encoding we can represent an object as large as 2^74 bytes,
which is also an infeasible size to process in JGit.

So drop the second read here.

The data offsets we pass into the ObjectLoaders being constructed
need to be computed individually now.  This saves a local variable,
but pushes the addition operation into each branch of the switch.

Originally when I wrote this code I had hoped to use OffsetCache
to also implement the UnpackedObjectCache.  But it turns out they
need rather different code, and it just wasn't worth trying to
reuse the OffsetCache base class.

Before doing any major refactoring or code cleanups here, squash the
two classes together and delete OffsetCache.  As WindowCache is our
only subclass, this is pretty simple to do.  We also get a minor
code reduction due to less duplication between the two classes,
and the JIT should be able to do a better job of optimization here
as we can define types up front rather than relying on generics
that erase back to java.lang.Object.

Because this is a refactoring, there are no code or logic changes
in this commit.  The two classes were simply combined together,
and any abstract or default implementations inside of OffsetCache

Rather than keep track of both the position of the object, and the
position of its data, just keep track of the number of bytes used
by the object's header in the pack.  This shaves 4 bytes out of the
size of the PackedObjectLoader instances.

We also can defer the addition instruction to the materialize()
operation, avoiding it entirely if the caller never actually uses
the loader.  This may be relevant for PackWriter invocations,
where only 1 loader gets chosen for a given object, even though
the object may appear on disk in more than one pack file.

Error reporting is now simplified, as we can rely on the object
offset rather than its data offset.  This is the value displayed
by pack debugging tools like `git verify-pack -v`, so its better
to use that in our own errors.

Because nobody needs getDataOffset() now, we can drop that from
the public API.

Rather than holding onto the PackedObjectLoader, only hold the
PackFile and the object offset.  During a reuse copy that is all
we should need to complete a reuse, and the other parts of the
PackedObjectLoader just waste memory.

This change reduces the per-object memory usage of a PackWriter by
32 bytes on a 32 bit JVM using only OFS_DELTA formatted objects.
The savings is even larger (by another 20 bytes) for REF_DELTAs.
This is close to a 50% reduction in the size of ObjectToPack,
making it rather worthwhile to do.

Beyond the memory reduction, this change will help to make future
refactoring work easier.  We need to redo the API used to support
copying data, and disconnecting it from the PackedObjectLoader is
a good first step.

The J2SE NIO APIs require that FileChannel close the underlying file
descriptor if a thread is interrupted while it is inside of a read or
write operation on that channel.  This is insane, because it means we
cannot share the file descriptor between threads.  If a thread is in
the middle of the FileChannel variant of IO.readFully() and it
receives an interrupt, the pack will be automatically closed on us.
This causes the other threads trying to use that same FileChannel to
receive IOExceptions, which leads to the pack getting marked as
invalid.  Once the pack is marked invalid, JGit loses access to its
entire contents and starts to report MissingObjectExceptions.

Because PackWriter must ensure that the chosen pack file stays
available until the current object's data is fully copied to the
output, JGit cannot simply reopen the pack when its automatically
closed due to an interrupt being sent at the wrong time.  The pack may
have been deleted by a concurrent `git gc` process, and that open file
descriptor might be the last reference to the inode on disk.  Once its
closed, the PackWriter loses access to that object representation, and
it cannot complete sending the object the client.

Fortunately, RandomAccessFile's readFully method does not have this
problem.  Interrupts during readFully() are ignored.  However, it
requires us to first seek to the offset we need to read, then issue
the read call.  This requires locking around the file descriptor to
prevent concurrent threads from moving the pointer before the read.

This reduces the concurrency level, as now only one window can be
paged in at a time from each pack.  However, the WindowCache should
already be holding most of the pages required to handle the working
set for a process, and its own internal locking was already limiting
us on the number of concurrent loads possible.  Provided that most
concurrent accesses are getting hits in the WindowCache, or are for
different repositories on the same server, we shouldn't see a major
performance hit due to the more serialized loading.

I would have preferred to use a pool of RandomAccessFiles for each
pack, with threads borrowing an instance dedicated to that thread
whenever they needed to page in a window.  This would permit much
higher levels of concurrency by using multiple file descriptors (and
file pointers) for each pack.  However the code became too complex to
develop in any reasonable period of time, so I've chosen to retrofit
the existing code with more serialization instead.

This commit introduces classes with should replace WorkDirCheckout.
WorkDirCheckout uses the deprecated GitIndex which cannot handle
multiple stages and has to be replaced.
A lot of effort went into testing to be able to reuse the existing
test in ReadTreeTest. Now the tests for DirCacheCheckout subclass
the ReadTreeTest and therefore inherit the existing tests.
The tests have been enriched to check also for the work-dir state.

Under smart HTTP the biDirectionalPipe flag is false, and we return
back immediately at this point in the negotiation process.  There is
no need to flush the stream to the client, the request is over and
it will be automatically flushed out by the higher level servlet
that invoked us.  Avoiding flush here allows us to only use flush
after a progress message is sent during pack generation.

If UploadPack invokes flush() on the output stream we pass it, its
most likely the progress messages coming down the side band stream.
As pack generation can take a while, we want to push that down
at the client as early as we can, to keep the connection alive,
and to let the user know we are still working on their behalf.

Ensure we dump the temporary buffer whenever flush() is invoked,
otherwise the messages don't get sent in a timely fashion to the
user agent (in this case, git fetch).

We specifically don't implement flush() for ReceivePack right now,
as that protocol currently does not provide progress messages to
the user, but it does invoke flush several times, as the different
streams include '0000' type flush-pkts to denote various end points.

The ObjectInserter API permits ObjectDatabase implementations to
control their own object insertion behavior, rather than forcing
it to always be a new loose file created in the local filesystem.
Inserted objects can also be queued and written asynchronously to
the main application, such as by appending into a pack file that
is later closed and added to the repository.

This change also starts to open the door to non-file based object
storage, such as an in-memory HashMap for unit testing, or a more
complex system built on top of a distributed hash table.

To help existing application code port to the newer interface we
are keeping ObjectWriter as a delegation wrapper to the new API.
Each ObjectWriter instances holds a reference to an ObjectInserter
for the Repository's top-level ObjectDatabase, and it flushes and
releases that instance on each object processed.

typically using the file backend which doesn't need a release, but
in the future should use an in-memory HashMap based store, which
really wouldn't need it either.

Its not strictly required that we sort topologically in order to
produce a valid pack file.  This was just something that Linus
thought would be a good idea to do.  In practice its not that
important for most repositories.  Local file IO quickly falls
out of the pattern that topological sorting provides any sort
of benefit for, so expending extra resources to enforce it when
we make a pack isn't really worth it.

I'm removing this sort in the pipeline because later changes
would support really efficient COMMIT_TIME_DESC sorting on a
non-file storage system, but TOPO sorting would be a bit more
ugly to run, due to the in-memory delays it imposes.

This opens the door for later refactorings to support pulling common
APIs out of FileRepository back up into lib.Repository, and then
implementing storage systems that aren't on the local filesystem,
such as an in-memory system for unit testing.

A handful of minor, previously non-public APIs had to be made public
to suppport this change.  Its a minor hazard, and one that really
doesn't harm the project that badly, and they may even be needed by
the other storage APIs anyway.

We want to eventually get rid of the mapCommit, mapTree APIs on

a good first step.

It actually simplifies the code a bit, as we no longer need to
keep track of an ObjectId and an Object (the parsed form), since
all RevObjects implicitly have their ObjectId readily available.

Because PackedObjectLoader is also considered a private detail of
PackFile, we have to make PackWriter temporarily dependent upon the
WindowCursor and thus FileRepository and ObjectDirectory in order to
just start the refactoring.  In later changes we will clean up the
APIs more, exposing sufficient support to PackWriter without needing
the file specific implementation details.

So, just inline the constant here.  Its as foribidden as "":"" is.

Rather than relying on the repository's ability to give us the

the ObjectInserter for the repository.  We have to recompress it,
which may slow down fetches, but this is the slow dumb protocol.
The extra cost to do the compression locally isn't going to be a
major bottleneck.

This nicely removes the nasty part about computing the object
identity by hand, allowing us to instead rely upon the inserter's
internal computation.  Unfortunately it means we might store a loose
object whose SHA-1 doesn't match the expected SHA-1, such as if the
remote repository was corrupted.  This is fairly harmless, as the
incorrectly named object will now be stored under its proper name,
and will eventually be garbage collected, as its not referenced by
the local repository.

We have to flush the inserter after the object is stored because
we aren't sure if we need to read the object later, or not.

Replace the old crude event listener system with a much more generic
implementation, patterned after the event dispatch techniques used
in Google Web Toolkit 1.5 and later.

Each event delivers to an interface that defines a single method,
and the event itself is what performs the delivery in a type-safe
way through its own dispatch method.

Listeners are registered in a generic listener list, indexed by
the interface they implement and wish to receive an event for.
Delivery of events is performed by looping through all listeners
implementing the event's corresponding listener interface, and using
the event's own dispatch method to deliver the event.  This is the
classical ""double dispatch"" pattern for event delivery.

Listeners can be unregistered by invoking remove() on their
registration handle.  This change therefore requires application
code to track the handle if it wishes to remove the listener at a
later point in time.

Event delivery is now exposed as a generic public method on the
Repository class, making it easier for any type of message to
be sent out to any type of listener that has registered, without
needing to pre-arrange for type-safe fireFoo() methods.

New event types can be added in the future simply by defining a
new RepositoryEvent subclass and a corresponding RepositoryListener
interface that it dispatches to.  By always adding new events through
a new interface, we never need to worry about defining an Adapter
to provide default no-op implementations of new event methods.

The ObjectReader class is dual-purposed into being a factory for the
ObjectToPack, permitting specific ObjectDatabase implementations
to override the method and offer their own custom subclass of the
generic ObjectToPack class.  By allowing them to directly extend the
type, each implementation can add custom fields to support tracking
where an object is stored, without incurring any additional penalties
like a parallel Map<ObjectId,Object> would cost.

The reader was chosen to act as a factory rather than the database,
as the reader will eventually be tied more tightly with the
ObjectWalk and TreeWalk.  During object enumeration the reader
would have had to load the object for the RevWalk, and may chose
to cache object position data internally so it can later be reused
and fed into the ObjectToPack instance supplied to the PackWriter.
Since a reader is not thread-safe, and is scoped to this PackWriter
and its internal ObjectWalk, its a great place for the database to
perform caching, if any.

Right now this change goes a bit backwards by changing what should
be generic ObjectToPack references inside of PackWriter to the very
PackFile specific LocalObjectToPack subclass.  We will correct these
in a later commit as we start to refine what the ObjectToPack API
will eventually look like in order to better support the PackWriter.

Output of selected reuses is refactored to use a new ObjectReuseAsIs
interface that extends the ObjectReader.  This interface allows the
reader to control how it performs the reuse into the output stream,
but also allows it to throw an exception to request the writer to
find a different candidate representation.

The PackFile reuse code was overhauled, cleaning up the APIs so they
aren't exposed in the object loader, but instead are now a single
method on the PackFile itself.  The reuse algorithm was changed to do
a data verification pass, followed by the copy pass to the output.
This permits us to work around a corrupt object in a pack file by
seeking another copy of that object when this one is bad.

The reuse code was also optimized for the common case, where the
in-pack representation is under 16 KiB.  In these smaller cases
data is sent to the pack writer more directly, avoiding some copying.

Objects that fall completely within a single window can be worked
with in a zero-copy fashion, provided that the window is backed by
a normal byte[] and not by a ByteBuffer.

This works for a surprising number of objects.  The default window
size is 8 KiB, but most deltas are quite a bit smaller than that.
Objects smaller than 1/2 of the window size have a very good chance
of falling completely within a window's array, which means we can
work with them without copying their data around.

Larger objects, or objects which are unlucky enough to span over a
window boundary, get copied through the temporary buffer.  We pay
a tiny penalty to realize we can't use the zero-copy code path,
but its easier than trying to keep track of two adjacent windows.

With this change (as well as everything preceeding it), packing
is actually a bit faster.  Some crude benchmarks based on cloning

This move isolates all of the local file specific implementation code

Because of the sheer number of files impacted, I have limited this
change to only the renames and the updated imports.

Rather than making a loader, and then using that to fill the object
representation, parse the header and set up our data directly.
This saves some time, as we don't waste cycles on information we
won't use right now.

The weight computed for a representation is now its actual stored
size in the pack file, rather than its inflated size.  This accounts
for changes made when the compression level is modified on the
repository.  It is however more costly to determine the weight of
the object, since we have to find its length in the pack.  To try and
recover that cost we now cache the length as part of our ObjectToPack
record, so it doesn't have to be found during the output phase.

A LocalObjectToPack now costs us (assuming 32 bit pointers):

                   (32 bit)     (64 bit)

We no longer need an ObjectLoader to be lazy and try to delay
the materialization of the object content.  That was done only
to support PackWriter searching for a good reuse candidate.

Instead, simplify the code base by doing the materialization
immediately when the loader asks for it, because any caller
asking for the loader is going to need the content.

is what allocated it, it makes sense to have it also do the release.

The ObjectReader API demands that we release the reader when we are
done with it.  PackWriter contains a reader, which it uses for the
entire packing session.  Expose the release of the reader through
a release method on the writer.

This still doesn't address the RevWalk and TreeWalk users, who
don't correctly release their reader.  But its a small step in the
right direction.

Update a number of calling sites of RevWalk to ensure the walker's
internal ObjectReader is released after the walk is no longer used.
Because the ObjectReader is likely to hold onto a native resource
like an Inflater, we don't want to leak them outside of their
useful scope.

Where possible we also try to share ObjectReaders across several
walk pools, or between a walker and a PackWriter.  This permits
the ObjectReader to actually do some caching if it felt inclined
to do so.

Not everything was updated, we'll probably need to come back and
update even more call sites, but these are some of the biggest
offenders.  Test cases in particular aren't updated.  My plan is to
move most storage-agnostic tests onto some purely in-memory storage
solution that doesn't do compression.

Big loose objects can now be streamed if they are over the large
object size threshold.  This prevents the JVM heap from exploding
with a very large byte array to hold the slurped file, and then
again with its uncompressed copy.

We may have slightly slowed down the simple case for small
loose objects, as the loader no longer slurps the entire thing
and decompresses in memory.  To try and keep good performance
for the very common small objects that are below 8 KiB in size,
buffers are set to 8 KiB, causing the reader to slurp most of the
file anyway.  However the data has to be copied at least once,
from the BufferedInputStream into the InflaterInputStream.

New unit tests are supplied to get nearly 100% code coverage on the
unpacked code paths, for both standard and pack style loose objects.
We tested a fair chunk of the code elsewhere, but these new tests
are better isolated to the specific branches in the code path.

Similar to the loose object support, whole packed objects can
now be streamed back to the caller.  The streaming is less
efficient as we copy the data from the cached window array
into the InflaterInputStream's internal buffer, then inflate
it there before returning to the application.

Like with unpacked objects, there is plenty of room for some
optimization, especially for the copyTo method, where we don't
necessarily need so much buffering to exist.

Very large delta instruction streams, or deltas which use very large
base objects, are now streamed through as large objects rather than
being inflated into a byte array.

This isn't the most efficient way to access delta encoded content, as
we may need to rewind and reprocess the base object when there was a
block moved within the file, but it will at least prevent the JVM from
having its heap explode.

When streaming a delta we have an inflater open for each level in the
delta chain, to inflate the instruction set of the delta, as well as
an inflater for the base level object.  The base object is buffered,
as is the top level delta requested by the application, but we do not
buffer the intermediate delta streams.  This keeps memory usage lower,
so its closer to 1024 bytes per level in the chain, without having an
adverse impact on raw throughput as the top-level buffer gets pushed
down to the lowest stream that has the next region.

Delta instructions transparently collapse here, if the top level does
not copy a region from its base, the base won't materialize that part
from its own base, etc.  This allows us to avoid copying around a lot
of segments which have been deleted from the final version.

Callers don't necessarily need the getSize() result from a large

for blobs going to local files, or they should be checking the
result of the constant-time isLarge() method to determine the type
of access they can use on the ObjectLoader.  Avoid inflating the
delta instruction stream twice by delaying the decoding of the size
until after we have created the DeltaStream and decoded the header.

Likewise with the type, callers don't necessarily always need it
to be present in an ObjectLoader.  Delay looking at it as late as
we can, thereby avoiding an ugly O(N^2) loop looking up the type
for every single object in the entire delta chain.

I had added SHA1 based rename detection in a prior commit. This class
builds on that work by adding content based rename detection, along
the lines of what C Git does. This content based detection works by
hashing portions of each file (every 60 bytes or until a newline)
and populating a hash table of content hash -> number of occurences.
It then walks through the hash tables it created for the files to
determine commonality. Finally, it determines the files most likely
to be renames based on their commonality.

A programming error using the Inflater API led to an infinite

the inflate() method, but it didn't want more input.  This happens
when it has reached the end of the stream, or has reached a spot
asking for an external dictionary.  Such a case is a failure for us,
and we should abort out.

- abstract methods for checkout and prescanTwoTrees have been
  introduced. Parameters are only the two trees. As index we
  will implicitly use the current index of the repo.
- whenever tests needed a manipulated index before checkout
  and prescanTwoTrees it was ensured that the correct index was
  persisted (before we could use not-persisted instantiations of GitIndex
  passed as parameters to checkout, prescanTwoTrees
- abstract methods for getting updated, conflicting, removed entries

- an implementation for all these abstract methods using WorkDirCheckout
  has been added
- method to assert a certain state of the index and the working tree has
  been added

are DiffEntrys with a buffer containing the diff output as well as
a list of HunkHeaders. The HunkHeaders contain EditLists. The
createFileHeader(DiffEntry) method in DiffFormatter performs a Myers
Diff on the files refered to by the DiffEntry, then puts the returned
EditList into a single HunkHeader, which is then put into the
FileHeader to be returned. It also generates the appropriate diff
header an puts it into the FileHeader's buffer. The rest of the diff
output, which would normally be parsed to generate the HunkHeaders,
is not generated. In fact, the purpose of this method is to avoid
the costly diff output generation and parsing normally required to
create a FileHeader.

The scoring logic in SimilarityIndex was dividing by the max file
size. If both files are empty, this would cause a div by zero
error. This case cannot currently happen, since two empty files
would have the same SHA1, and would therefore be caught in the
earlier SHA1 based detection pass. Still, if this logic eventually
gets separated from that pass, a div by zero error would occur.

I changed the logic to instead consider two empty files to have a
similarity score of 100.

with a count as large as 0xffffff (~15.9 MiB), pack version 2 streams
are only supposed to use delta copy instructions up to 64 KiB.

Rewrite our copy instruction encode loop to use the lower 64 KiB
limit, even though modern decoders would support longer copies.

To improve encoding performance we now try to encode up to four full
copy commands in our buffer before we flush it to the stream, but
we don't try to implement full buffering here.  We are just trying
to amortize the virtual method call to the destination stream when
we have to do a large copy.

DeltaIndex is a simple pack style delta generator.  The function works
by creating a compact index of a source buffer's blocks, and then
walking a sliding window along a desired result buffer, searching for
the window in the index.  When a match is found, the window is
stretched to the longest possible length that is common with the
source buffer, and a copy instruction is created.

Rabin's polynomial hash function is used to compute the hash for a
block, permitting efficient sliding of the window in single byte
increments.  The update function to slide one byte originated from
David Mazieres' work in LBFS, and our implementation of the update
step was certainly inspired by the initial work Geert Bosch proposed
for C Git in http://marc.info/?l=git&m=114565424620771&w=2.

To ensure the encoder runs in linear time with respect to the size of
the two input buffers (source and result), the maximum number of
blocks that can share the same position in the index's hashtable is
capped at a constant number.  This prevents bad inputs from causing
the encoder to run in quadratic time, but comes with a penalty of
creating a longer delta due to fewer considered copy positions.

Strange hackery is used to cap the amount of memory used by the index
to be no more than 12 bytes for every 16 bytes of source buffer, no
matter what the JVM per-object overhead is.  This permits an index to
always be no larger than 1.75x the source buffer length, which is an
important feature to support large windows of candidates to match
against while packing.  Here the strange hackery is nothing more than
a manually managed chained hashtable, where pointers are array indexes
into storage arrays rather than object references.

Computation of the hash function for a single fixed sized block is
done through an unrolled loop, where the first 4 iterations have been
manually reduced down to eliminate unnecessary instructions.  The
pattern is derived from ObjectId.equals(byte[], int, byte[], int),
where we have unrolled the loop required to compare two 20 byte
arrays.  Hours of testing with the Sun 1.6 JRE concluded that the
non-obvious ""foo[idx + 1]"" style of reference is faster than
""foo[idx++]"", and so that is what we use here during hashing.

PackWriter now produces new deltas if there is not a suitable delta
available for reuse from an existing pack file.  This permits JGit to
send less data on the wire by sending a delta relative to an object
the other side already has, instead of sending the whole object.

The delta searching algorithm is similar in style to what C Git
uses, but apparently has some differences (see below for more on).
Briefly, objects that should be considered for delta compression are
pushed onto a list.  This list is then sorted by a rough similarity
score, which is derived from the path name the object was discovered
at in the repository during object counting.  The list is then
walked in order.

At each position in the list, up to $WINDOW objects prior to it
are attempted as delta bases.  Each object in the window is tried,
and the shortest delta instruction sequence selects the base object.
Some rough rules are used to prevent pathological behavior during
this matching phase, like skipping pairings of objects that are
not similar enough in size.

PackWriter intentionally excludes commits and annotated tags from
this new delta search phase.  In the JGit repository only 28 out
of 2600+ commits can be delta compressed by C Git.  As the commit
count tends to be a fair percentage of the total number of objects
in the repository, and they generally do not delta compress well,
skipping over them can improve performance with little increase in
the output pack size.

Because this implementation was rebuilt from scratch based on my own
memory of how the packing algorithm has evolved over the years in
C Git, PackWriter, DeltaWindow, and DeltaEncoder don't use exactly
the same rules everywhere, and that leads JGit to produce different
(but logically equivalent) pack files.

  Repository | Pack Size (bytes)                | Packing Time
             | JGit     - CGit     = Difference | JGit / CGit
  -----------+----------------------------------+-----------------
   git       | 25094348 - 24322890 = +771458    | 59.434s / 59.133s
   jgit      |  5669515 -  5709046 = - 39531    |  6.654s /  6.806s
   linux-2.6 |     389M -     386M = +3M        |  20m02s / 18m01s

For the above tests pack.threads was set to 1, window size=10,
delta depth=50, and delta and object reuse was disabled for both
implementations.  Both implementations were reading from an already
fully packed repository on local disk.  The running time reported
is after 1 warm-up run of the tested implementation.

PackWriter is writing 771 KiB more data on git.git, 3M more on
linux-2.6, but is actually 39.5 KiB smaller on jgit.git.  Being
larger by less than 0.7% on linux-2.6 isn't bad, nor is taking an
extra 2 minutes to pack.  On the running time side, JGit is at a
major disadvantage because linux-2.6 doesn't fit into the default
WindowCache of 20M, while C Git is able to mmap the entire pack and
have it available instantly in physical memory (assuming hot cache).

CGit also has a feature where it caches deltas that were created
during the compression phase, and uses those cached deltas during
the writing phase.  PackWriter does not implement this (yet),
and therefore must create every delta twice.  This could easily
account for the increased running time we are seeing.

PackWriter now caches small deltas, or deltas that are very tiny
compared to their source inputs, so that the writing phase goes
faster by reusing those cached deltas.

The cached data is stored compressed, which usually translates to
a bigger footprint due to deltas being very hard to compress, but
saves time during writing by avoiding the deflate step.  They are
held under SoftReferences so that the JVM GC can clear out deltas
if memory gets very tight.  We would rather continue working and
spend a bit more CPU time during writing than crash due to OOME.

To avoid OutOfMemoryErrors during the caching phase we also trap
OOME and just abort out of the caching.

Because deflateBound() always produces something larger than what
we need to actually store the deflated data, we copy it over into
a new buffer if the actual length doesn't match the buffer length.
When packing jgit.git this saves over 111 KiB in the cache, and is
thus a worthwhile hit on CPU time.

To further save memory we store the inflated size of the delta
(which we need for the object header) in the same field as the
pathHash, as the pathHash is no longer necessary by this phase
of the packing algorithm.

During the exact rename detection phase in RenameDetector, ties were
resolved on a first-found basis. I added support for file path based
tie breaking during that phase. Basically, there are four situations
that have to be handled:

One add matching one delete:
	In this simple case, we pair them as a rename.

One add matching many deletes:
	Find the delete whos path matches the add the closest, and
	pair them as a rename.

Many adds matching one delete:
	Similar to the above case, we find the add that matches the
	delete the closest, and pair them as a rename. The other adds
	are marked as copies of the delete.

Many adds matching many deletes:
	Build a scoring matrix similar to the one used for content-
	based matching, scoring instead by file path. Some of the
	utility functions in SimilarityRenameDetector are used in
	this case, as we use the same encoding scheme. Once the
	matrix is built, scan it for the best matches, marking them
	as renames. The rest are marked as copies.

I don't particularly like the idea of using utility functions right
out of SimilarityRenameDetector, but it works for the moment. A later
commit will likely refactor this into a common utility class, as well
as bringing exact rename detection out of RenameDetector and into a
separate class, much like SimilarityRenameDetector.

In order to test racy git situations we have to be able to control
the last-modification timestamps of the filesystem. Since we already
access the modification timestamps of files through an abstraction
(the WorkingTreeIterator) I add a new implementation of this iterator
which allows to map timestamp-ranges to single constant timestamps.
For users of this iterator it looks like all files in that range
have been modified at exactly the same time.
With the help of this iterator a test has been writting which
checkes for racy git handling (smudging, unsmudging, dirty-detection).

Additionally add a method to RepositoryTestCase which encodes the
current index state in one String. This should include info about
pathes, file/index modtime, smudgeState, clean-state. Make
sure timestamps are presented in a way that it is easy to
write assertions against this strings (no concrete milliseconds
but t0,t1,...).

These two topics depend circulary on each other: thats why they have
been squashed in one commit.

A file exists at src/a.txt containing ""foo"". A user renames src/a.txt
to src/b.txt, then adds a new src/a.txt containing ""bar"".

Even though the old a.txt and the new b.txt are identical, the
rename detection algorithm would not detect it as a rename since it
was already paired in a MODIFY. I added code to split all MODIFYs
below a certain score into their constituent ADD/DELETE pairs. This
allows situations like the one I described above to be more
correctly handled.

the following tests fail under windows because certain inputstreams
are not closed and files cannot be deleted because of that.  The
main problem I found is UnpackedObject.InflaterInputStream.close().
This method may throw exceptions found by checkValidEndOfStream()
but doesn't call super.close() before leaving. It is not clear to me
which resources a close() method should release before it throws an
exception. But those reseources which are not published to the
outside and which therefore cannot be closed by other means have to
be closed in all cases.
I changed the close() method to call super.close() under all
circumstances.

This refactoring permits applications to configure global per-process
settings for all packing and easily pass it through to per-request
PackWriters, ensuring that the process configuration overrides the
repository specific settings.

For example this might help in a daemon environment where the server
wants to cap the resources used to serve a dynamic upload pack
request, even though the repository's own pack.* settings might be
configured to be more aggressive.  This allows fast but less bandwidth
efficient serving of clients, while still retaining good compression
through a cron managed `git gc`.

When the output stream is deeply buffered (e.g. 1 MiB or more in
an HTTP servlet on some containers) trying to kick out the header
earlier will prevent the client from stalling hard while the first
1 MiB is received and it can process the pack header.  Forcing a
flush here lets the client see the header and start its progress
monitor for ""Receiving objects: (1/N)"" so the user knows there
is still activity occurring, even though the buffering may cause
there to be some lag as the buffer fills up on the sending side.

ObjectReader implementations may wish to use multiple threads in
order to evaluate object reuse faster.  Let the reader make that
decision by passing the iteration down into the reader.

Because the work is pushed into the reader, it may need to locate a
given ObjectToPack given its ObjectId.  This can easily occur if the
reader has sent a list of ObjectIds to the object database and gets
back information keyed only by ObjectId, without the ObjectToPack
handle.  Expose lookup using the PackWriter's own internal map,
so the reader doesn't need to build a redundant copy to track the
assocation of ObjectId back to ObjectToPack.

By giving the reader information about the roots of a revision
traversal, some readers may be able to prefetch information from
their backing store using background threads in order to reduce
data access latency.  However this isn't typically necessary so
the default reader implementation doesn't react to the advice.

An ObjectReader implementation may be very slow for a single object,
but yet support bulk queries efficiently by batching multiple small
requests into a single larger request.  This easily happens when the
reader is built on top of a database that is stored on another host,
as the network round-trip time starts to dominate the operation cost.

RevWalk, ObjectWalk, UploadPack and PackWriter are the first major
users of this new bulk interface, with the goal being to support an
efficient way to pack a repository for a fetch/clone client when the
source repository is stored in a high-latency storage system.

Processing the want/have lists is now done in bulk, to remove
the high costs associated with common ancestor negotiation.

PackWriter already performs object reuse selection in bulk, but it
now can also do the object size lookup and object counting phases
with higher efficiency.  Actual object reuse, deltification, and
final output are still doing sequential lookups, making them a bit
more expensive to perform.

This still gives us room for delta chains of 1,048,576 objects,
and that is just insane.  Unpacking 1 million objects to get to
something is longer than most users are willing to wait for data
from Git.

The reuse system used by an object database may be able to benefit
from knowing what objects are coming next, and even improve data
throughput by delaying (or moving up) objects that are stored near
each other in the source database.

Pushing the iteration down into the reuse code makes it possible
for a smarter implementation to aggregate reuse.  But for the
standard pack file format on disk we don't bother, its quite
efficient already.

A bug in rename detection would cause file scores to be wrong. The
bug was due to the way rename detection would judge the similarity
between files. If file A has three lines containing 'foo', and file
B has 5 lines containing 'foo', the rename detection phase should
record that A and B have three lines in common (the minimum of the
number of times that line appears in both files). Instead, it would
choose the the number of times the line appeared in the destination
file, in this case file B. I fixed the bug by having the
SimilarityIndex instead choose the minimum number, as it should. I
also added a test case to verify that the bug had been fixed.

This restores the transitivity and symmetry properties of the equals
methods on the AnyObjectId type hierarchy as defined in [1]. 
Following [2] we declare these equals methods final to ensure that 
semantics of equals are consistent across AnyObjectId's type hierarchy.

This patch fixes the problem that JGit tests run from Maven fail on
Mac OS X [1]. In Eclipse the tests succeed since we set Eclipse
workspace encoding to UTF-8 via ""Preferences > General > Workspace

the JVM system property of the test run. This change copies this 
setting to the Maven test environment so that we get consistent test
results on all platforms.

When RevObject overrode equals() to provide only reference equality
we used to need to convert a RevObject into an ObjectId by copy()
just to use standard Java tools like JUnit assertEquals(), or to
use contains() or get() on standard java.util collection types.

Now that we have removed this override and made ObjectId's equals()
final (preventing any of this mess in the future), some copy()
calls are unnecessary.  Anytime the value is being used as an input
to a lookup routine, or to an equals, we can avoid the copy().

However we still want to use copy() anytime we are given an ObjectId
that may exist long-term, where we don't want the high cost of the
additional storage from a RevCommit extension.  So we can't remove
all uses of copy(), just some of them.

to give us a large loader.  In general commits or tags are always
under the several MiB limit, so even if the loader calls it ""large""
we should still be able to afford the JVM heap memory required to
get a single byte array.  Coerce even large loaders into a single
byte array anyway.

Applications should favor the long style interface, especially when
their source input is a long type, e.g. coming from java.io.File.
This way when the index format is later changed to support a
larger file size than 2 GiB we can handle it by just changing the
entry code, and not need to fix a lot of applications.

ObjectReader implementations are now responsible for creating the

multiple candidates to the caller, who may be able to disambiguate
them based on context.

Repository.resolve() doesn't take multiple candidates into account
right now, but it could in the future by looking for a remaining
^0 or ^{commit} suffix and take an expansion if there is only one
commit that matches the input abbreviation.  It could also use
the distance from an annotated tag to resolve ""tag-NNN-gcommit""
style strings that are often output by `git describe`.

Instead of duplicating this logic everywhere, lets put it into the

their upper size bound, and we'll do the rest of the heavy work to
figure out if the object still fits within that bound, and get them
an array that has the complete contents.

Applying deltas in the large streaming mode is horrifically slow.
Trying to pack icu4c is impossible because a single 11 MiB file
sits on top of a 15 MiB file though a 10 deep delta chain, which
results in this very slow inflate process.

Upping the default limit to 15 MiB lets us process this large in a
reasonable time, but its still sufficiently low enough to prevent
exploding the heap of a very large process like Eclipse or Gerrit
Code Review.

We have to revisit the streaming delta application process and do
something much smarter, like flatten the delta chain before we apply
it to the base.  But even that is ugly, I've seen a 155 MiB delta
sitting on top of a 450 MiB file to produce a 300 MiB result object.
If the chain is deep, we may have trouble flatting it down.

Large delta streams are unpacked incrementally, but because a delta
can seek to a random position in the base to perform a copy we may
need to inflate the base repeatedly just to complete one delta.
So work around it by copying the base to a temporary file, and then
we can read from that temporary file using random seeks instead.
Its far more efficient because we now only need to inflate the
base once.

This is still really ugly because we have to dump to a temporary
file, but at least the code can successfully process a large
file without throwing OutOfMemoryError.  If speed is an
issue, the user will need to increase the JVM heap and ensure
core.streamFileThreshold is set to a higher value, so we don't use
this code path as often.

Unfortunately we lose the ""optimization"" of skipping over portions
of a delta base that we don't actually need in the final result.
This is going to cause us to inflate and write to disk useless
regions that were deleted and do not appear in the final result.
We could later improve on our code by trying to flatten delta
instruction streams before we touch the bottom base object, and
then only store the portions of the base we really need for the
final result and that appear out-of-order.  Since that is some
pretty complex code I'm punting on it for now and just doing this
simple whole-object buffering.

Because the process umask might be permitting other users to read
files we create, we put the temporary buffers into $GIT_DIR/objects.
We can reasonably assume that if a reader can read our temporary
buffer file in that directory, they can also read the base pack
file we are pulling it from and therefore its not a security breach
to expose the inflated content in a file.  This requires a reader
to have write access to the repository, but only if the file is
really big.  I'd rather err on the side of caution here and refuse
to read a very big file into /tmp than to possibly expose a secured
content because the Java 5 JVM won't let us create a protected
temporary file that only the current user can access.

On Mac OS X MyerDiffPerformanceTest was failing since during the

the tests. When setting the JVM option -Xbatch forcing the JIT to do
its work prior to running the code this effect can be avoided. Instead
we chose to run some tests without recording prior to the recorded

The merge algorithm was reporting conflicts which where to big.

Example: The common base was ""ABC"", the ""ours"" version contained

contained ""AB1C"". We have two potentially conflicting edits in the
same region which happen to bring in exactly the same content. This
should not be a conflict - but was previously reported as
""AB<<<1===1>>>C"".

This is fixed by checking every conflicting chunk whether the
conflicting regions have a common prefix or suffix and by removing
this regions from the conflict.

Its a small amount of unnecessary work to buffer the file header,
but these are typically very tiny so the cost to format and reparse
is relatively low.

When adding or deleting a file, we shouldn't ever prefix /dev/null
with the a/ or b/ prefixes.  Doing so is a mistake and confuses a
patch parser which handles /dev/null magically, while a/dev/null is
a file called null in the dev directory of the project.

Also when adding or deleting the ""diff --git"" line has the ""real""
path on both sides, so we should see the following when adding the
file called foo:

  diff --git a/foo b/foo
  --- /dev/null
  +++ b/foo

The --- and +++ lines do not appear in a pure rename or copy delta,

omit the index line when the ObjectIds are exactly equal.

When we are asked to create a difference between two files the caller
really wants to see that output.  Instead of punting because a file
is too big to process, consider it to be binary.  This reduces the
accuracy of our output display, but makes it a lot more likely that
the formatter can still generate something semi-useful.

We set our default binary threshold to 50 MiB, which is the same
threshold that PackWriter uses before punting and deciding a file
is too big to delta compress.  Anything under this size we try to
load and process, anything over that size (or that won't allocate
in the heap) gets tagged as binary.

This allows callers to force the iterator back to its starting point,

back(1) until first() is true, but this isn't very efficient for any
iterator.  All current implementations have better ways to implement

When comparing a DirCache and a WorkingTree using ANY_DIFF we
sometimes didn't recursive into a subtree of both sides gave us
zeroId() back for the identity of a subtree.  This happens when the
DirCache doesn't have a valid cache tree for the subtree, as then
it uses zeroId() for the ObjectId of the subtree, which then appears
to be equal to the zeroId() of the WorkingTreeIterator's subtree.

We work around this by adding a hasId() method that returns true
only if this iterator has a valid ObjectId.  The idEquals method
on TreeWalk than only performs a compare between two iterators if
both iterators have a valid id.

If the iterators passed into a diff formatter are working tree
iterators, we should enable ignoring files that are ignored, as
well as actually pull up the current content from the working tree
rather than getting it from the repository.

Because we abstract away the working directory access logic,
we can now actually support rename detection between the working
directory and the local repository when using a DiffFormatter.
This means its possible for an application to show an unstaged
delete-add pair as a rename if the add path is not ignored.
(Because the ignored file wouldn't show up in our difference output.)

Even more interesting is we can now do rename detection between any
two working trees, if both input iterators are WorkingTreeIterators.

Unfortunately we don't (yet) optimize for comparing the working
tree with the index involved so we can take advantage of cached
stat data to rule out non-dirty paths.

an object buffer is similar to the limit on how much we can use for

not just a single repository, so it should be a global limit.

size, and when the higher level reader uses the same buffer size
the buffers ""stack"" nicely by avoiding a copy to the internal
buffer array.  As OpenJDK is a popular virtual machine, we should
try to benefit from this nice stacking property during copyTo().

If the copy instruction was larger than the input buffer given to us,
we copied the wrong part of the base stream during the next read().

This occurred on really big binary files where a copy instruction
of 64k wasn't unreasonable, but the caller's buffer was only 8192
bytes long.  We copied the first 8192 bytes correctly, but then
reseeked the base stream back to the start of the copy region on
the second read of 8192 bytes.  Instead of a sequence like ABCD
being read into the caller, we read AAAA.

Since we are only checking the links between objects we don't need
to hold onto commit messages after their headers have been parsed
by the walker.  Dropping them saves a bit of memory, which is always
good when accepting huge pack files.

When checkReferencedIsReachable is set in ReceivePack we are trying
to prove that the push client is permitted to access an object that
it did not send to us, but that the received objects link to either
via a link inside of an object (e.g. commit parent pointer or tree
member) or by a delta base reference.

To do this check we are making a list of every potential delta base,
and then ensuring that every delta base used appears on this list.
If a delta base does not appear on this list, we abort with an error,
letting the client know we are missing a particular object.

Preventing spurious errors about missing delta base objects requires
us to use the exact same list of potential delta bases as the remote
push client used.  This means we must use TOPO ordering, and we
need to enable BOUNDARY sorting so that ObjectWalk will correctly
include any trees found during the enumeration back to the common
merge base between the interesting and uninteresting heads.

To ensure JGit's own push client matches this same potential delta
base list, we need to undo 60aae90d4d15 (""Disable topological
sorting in PackWriter"") and switch back to using the conventional
TOPO ordering for commits in a pack file.  This ensures that our
own push client will use the same potential base object list as
checkReferencedIsReachable uses on the receiving side.

This class is used only to cache the unpacked form of an object that
was used as a base for another object.  The theory goes that if an
object is used as a delta base for A, it will probably also be a
delta base for B, C, D, E, etc. and therefore having an unpacked copy
of it on hand will make delta resolution for the others very fast.

However since objects are usually only accessed once, we don't want
to cache everything we unpack, just things that we are likely to
need again.  The only things we need again are the delta bases.
Hence, its a delta base cache.

This gets us the class name UnpackedObjectCache back, so we can
use it to actually create a cache of unpacked object information.

Recently created objects are usually what branches point to, and
are usually written out as loose objects.  But due to the high cost
of asking the operating system if a file exists, these are the last
thing that ObjectDirectory examines when looking for an object by
its ObjectId.

Caching recently seen loose objects permits the opening code to
jump directly to the loose object, accelerating lookup for branch
heads that are accessed often.

To avoid exploding the cache its limited to approximately 2048
entries.  When more ids are added, the table is simply cleared
and reset in size.

Instead of spooling large delta bases into temporary files and then
immediately deleting them afterwards, spool the large delta out to
a normal loose object.  Later any requests for that large delta can
be answered by reading from the loose object, which is much easier
to stream efficiently for readers.

Since the object is now duplicated, once in the pack as a delta and
again as a loose object, a `git prune-packed` will automatically
delete the loose object variant, releasing the wasted disk space.

As prune-packed is run automatically during repack and gc, and gc
--auto triggers automatically based on the number of loose objects,
we get automatic cache management almost for free.  Large objects
that were unpacked will be periodically cleared out, and will simply
be restored later if they are needed again.

After a short offline discussion with Junio Hamano today, we might
later want to propose a change to prune-packed to hold onto larger
loose objects which also exist in pack files as deltas if the loose
object was recently accessed in the last 2 days.

compares and unique hash codes for elements can really speed that
process up.

To make it easier to define element hash functions, move the caching
of hash codes into a wrapper sequence type, so that individual
sequence types like RawText don't need to do this themselves.  This
has a nice property of also allowing the sequence to no longer care
about the specific SequenceComparator that is going to be used, nad
permits the caching to only examine the middle region that isn't

However large delta objects found in a pack file are expanded into

Projects like org.eclipse.mdt contain large XML files about 6 MiB
in size.  So does the Android project platform/frameworks/base.
Doing a clone of either project with JGit takes forever to checkout
the files into the working directory, because delta decompression
tends to be very expensive as we need to constantly reposition the
base stream for each copy instruction.  This can be made worse by
a very bad ordering of offsets, possibly due to an XML editor that
doesn't preserve the order of elements in the file very well.

Increasing the threshold to the same limit PackWriter uses when
doing delta compression (50 MiB) permits a default configured
JGit to decompress these XML file objects using the faster
random-access arrays, rather than re-seeking through an inflate
stream, significantly reducing checkout time after a clone.

Since this new limit may be dangerously close to the JVM maximum
heap size, every allocation attempt is now wrapped in a try/catch
so that JGit can degrade by switching to the large object stream
mode when the allocation is refused.  It will run slower, but the
operation will still complete.

The large stream mode will run very well for big objects that aren't
delta compressed, and is acceptable for delta compressed objects that
are using only forward referencing copy instructions.  Copies using
prior offsets are still going to be horrible, and there is nothing
we can do about it except increase core.streamFileThreshold.

We might in the future want to consider changing the way the delta
generators work in JGit and native C Git to avoid prior offsets once
an object reaches a certain size, even if that causes the delta
instruction stream to be slightly larger.  Unfortunately native
C Git won't want to do that until its also able to stream objects
rather than malloc them as contiguous blocks.

concept of the simple reduceCommonStartEnd() step.  For most inputs,
there can be a significant number of elements that can be removed
from the space the DiffAlgorithm needs to consider, which will
reduce the overall running time for the final solution.

Pool this logic inside of DiffAlgorithm itself as a default, but
permit a specific algorithm to override it when necessary.

Convert MyersDiff to use this reduction to reduce the space it
needs to search, making it perform slightly better on common inputs.

The hash code returned by RawTextComparator (or that is used
by the SimilarityIndex) play an important role in the speed of
any algorithm that is based upon them.  The lower the number of
collisions produced by the hash function, the shorter the hash
chains within hash tables will be, and the less likely we are to
fall into O(N^2) runtime behaviors for algorithms like PatienceDiff.

Our prior hash function was absolutely horrid, so replace it with
the proper definition of the DJB hash that was originally published
by Professor Daniel J. Bernstein.

To support this assertion, below is a table listing the maximum
number of collisions that result when hashing the unique lines in
each source code file of 3 randomly chosen projects:

  test_jgit: 931 files; 122 avg. unique lines/file
   Algorithm    | Collisions
   -------------+-----------
   prior_hash            418
   djb                     5
   sha1                    6
   string_hash31          11

  test_linux26: 30198 files; 258 avg. unique lines/file
   Algorithm    | Collisions
   -------------+-----------
   prior_hash           8675
   djb                    32
   sha1                    8
   string_hash31          32

  test_frameworks_base: 8381 files; 184 avg. unique lines/file
   Algorithm    | Collisions
   -------------+-----------
   prior_hash           4615
   djb                    10
   sha1                    6
   string_hash31          13

We can clearly see that prior_hash performed very poorly, resulting
in 8,675 collisions (elements in the same hash bucket) for at least
one file in the Linux kernel repository.  This leads to some very
bad O(N) style insertion and lookup performance, even though the
hash table was sized to be the next power-of-2 larger than the
total number of unique lines in the file.

The djb hash we are replacing prior_hash with performs closer to
SHA-1 in terms of having very few collisions.  This indicates it
provides a reasonably distributed output for this type of input,
despite being a much simpler algorithm (and therefore will be much
faster to execute).

The string_hash31 function is provided just to compare results with,
it is the algorithm commonly used by java.lang.String hashCode().

However, life isn't quite this simple.

djb produces a 32 bit hash code, but our hash tables are always
smaller than 2^32 buckets.  Mashing the 32 bit code into an array
index used to be done by simply taking the lower bits of the hash
code by a bitwise and operator.  This unfortuntely still produces
many collisions, e.g. 32 on the linux-2.6 repository files.

From [1] we can apply a final ""cleanup"" step to the hash code to
mix the bits together a little better, and give priority to the
higher order bits as they include data from more bytes of input:

  test_jgit: 931 files; 122 avg. unique lines/file
   Algorithm    | Collisions
   -------------+-----------
   prior_hash            418
   djb                     5
   djb + cleanup           6

  test_linux26: 30198 files; 258 avg. unique lines/file
   Algorithm    | Collisions
   -------------+-----------
   prior_hash           8675
   djb                    32
   djb + cleanup           7

  test_frameworks_base: 8381 files; 184 avg. unique lines/file
   Algorithm    | Collisions
   -------------+-----------
   prior_hash           4615
   djb                    10
   djb + cleanup           7

This is a massive improvement, as the number of collisions for
common inputs drops to acceptable levels, and we haven't really
made the hash functions any more complex than they were before.

This is the test suite I was using to help understand why we had
such a high collision rate with RawTextComparator, and to select
a replacement function.

Since its not something we will run very often, lets make it a
program in the debug package rather than a JUnit test.  This way
we can run it on demand against any corpus of files we choose,
but we aren't bottlenecking our daily builds running tests with
no assertions.

Adding a new hash function to this suite is simple, just define
a new instance member of type ""Hash"" with the logic applied to
the region passed in.

When passing to a fallback algorithm, we can avoid creating a

hashed sequences directly.  This makes it cheaper to switch from
PatienceDiff to HistogramDiff to MyersDiff in a single pass.

There are quite some bugs related to our URI parsing in class URIish (see list
of referenced bugs). When trying to solve those and understand our parsing I
detected that we need more documention on the patterns we are using and maybe a
refactoring on how we construct those. Also the detection of wrong URIish
when the URIish was a local file reference has to be enhanced.

I extracted String constants for nearly every interesting part of our pattern
and documented each part. To detect wrong local file references I had to use
different patterns for standard URIs, local file references, SCP URIs and those
URIs created by java.io.File.toURI.toString().

I added more tests for file:// URIs and for wrong ssh URIs.

Application code, including unit tests for storage implementations,
should not extend RevCommit outside of the scope of using it for a
RevWalk.  Its a lot of overhead and unlikely to work long-term.

Instead for the one test that matters, use a custom subclass of the
ObjectId type.  This lets us measure exactly what we are looking for,
which is that the subclass isn't retained.

A lot of other tests were unnecessarily wrapping an object with a
RevCommit and storing that back into the RefUpdate.  This is just
retesting what the earlier no-cache test was doing, and complicated
the test considerably.  Drop that code and just rely on the value that
was configured by the helper method.

pointer before looking at an element, do it after, so the loop breaks

When working on a difference algorithm's implementation, its generally
more important to care about how it behaves on real-world inputs than
it does on fake inputs created for unit test cases.  Run each
implementation against a number of real-world repositories, looking at
changes between files in each commit.  This gives a better picture of
how a particular algorithm performs.

This test suite run against JGit and linux-2.6 with the current
available algorithms shows HistogramDiff always out-performs
MyersDiff, and by a wide margin on the linux-2.6 sources.  Since
histogram diff has similar properties as patience diff, the resulting
edits are probably also more human-readable.  These test results show
that HistogramDiff is a good choice for the default implementation.

If an ObjectInserter is created from a CachedObjectDirectory, we need
to ensure the cache is updated whenever a new loose object is actually
added to the loose objects directory, otherwise a future read from an
ObjectReader on the CachedObjectDirectory might not be able to open
the newly created object.

We mostly had the infrastructure in place to implement this due to the
injection of unpacked large deltas, but we didn't have a way to pass
the ObjectId from ObjectDirectoryInserter to CachedObjectDirectory,
because the inserter was using the underlying ObjectDirectory and not
the CachedObjectDirectory.  Redirecting to CachedObjectDirectory
ensures the cache is updated.

RefsDirectory fires a RefsChangedEvent when it detect that one
ref changed (new, modified, deleted). But there was a potential
of wrong events beeing fired leading to a endless loop in EGit.
Problem is that when calling getRefs(ALL) we don't want to report
additional refs and by that we remove the additional refs from
the list of ""refs reported upwards last time"". We fire an
RefsChangedEvent because we think that the special refs are not
there anymore.
I fixed this by removing eventing for the additional refs. Another
alternative would be to always scan also for additional refs and
put them in the list of refs. But getRefs(ALL) would then remove
the additional refs again. I didn't do that for performance reasons
and also because I am not sure whether we want evnting for
additional refs.

was not always reporting conflicts when the same line was deleted
and modified. This problem was introduced during commit
017188b4d41cc80c297e35097095026734b3d4 when reported conflicts have
been checked for common pre- and suffixes.
This was fixed here by better determining whether after stripping
off common prefixes and suffixes from a conflicting region there
is still some conflicting part left.
I also added a unit test to test this situation.

HistogramDiff failed on cases where the initial element for the LCS
was actually very common (e.g. has 20 occurrences), and the first
element of the inserted region after the LCS was also common but
had fewer occurrences (e.g. 10), while the LCS also contained a
unique element (1 occurrence).

This happens often in Java source code.  The initial element for
the LCS might be the empty line (""\n""), and the inserted but common
element might be ""\t/**\n"", with the LCS being a large span of
lines that contains unique method declarations.  Even though ""/**""
occurs less often than the empty line its not a better LCS if the
LCS we already have contains a unique element.

The logic in HistogramDiff would normally have worked fine, except I
tried to optimize scanning of B by making tryLongestCommonSequence
return the end of the region when there are matching elements
found in A.  This allows us to skip over the current LCS region,
as it has already been examined, but caused us to fail to identify
an element that had a lower occurrence count within the region.

The solution used here is to trade space-for-time by keeping a
table of A positions to their occurrence counts.  This allows the
matching logic to always use the smallest count for this region,
even if the smallest count doesn't appear on the initial element.

The new unit test testEdit_LcsContainsUnique() verifies this new
behavior works as expected.

The NoteMap makes it easy to read a small notes tree as created by
the `git notes` command in C Git.  To make the initial implementation
simple a notes tree is read recursively into a map in memory.
This is reasonable if the application will need to access all notes,
or if there are less than 256 notes in the tree, but doesn't behave
well when the number of notes exceeds 256 and the application
doesn't need to access all of them.

We can later add support for lazily loading different subpaths,
thus fixing the large note tree problem described above.

Currently the implementation only supports reading.  Writing notes
is more complex because trees need to be expanded or collapsed at
the exact 256 entry cut-off in order to retain the same tree SHA-1
that C Git would use for the same content.  It also needs to retain
non-note tree entries such as "".gitignore"" or "".gitattribute"" files
that might randomly appear within a notes tree.  We can also add
writing support later.

merge was failing because of conflicts. If the merge was
succesfull then deletions are handled correctly but if
collisions exist and the merge fails files which have
to be deleted (because there was a non-conflicting deletion
coming in from THEIRS) are not deleted. In theory that's
also true in the non-conflicting case but since in this
case we explicitly checkout in the end these files get
deleted during that checkout.

This is fixed by handling incoming deletions explicitly.

Instead of reading a note tree recursively up front when the NoteMap
is loaded, read only the root tree and load subtrees on demand when
they are accessed by the application.  This gives a lower latency
to read a note for the recent commits on a branch, as only the paths
that are needed get read.

Given a 2/38 style fanout, the tree will fully load when 256 objects
have been accessed by the application.  But unlike the prior version
of NoteMap, the NoteMap will load faster and answer lookups sooner,
as the loading time for all 256 levels is spread out across each of
the get() requests.

Given a 2/2/36 style fanout, the tree won't need to fully load until
about 65,536 objects are accessed.

Some repositories may be on really unstable filesystems, but still
want to have good reliability when objects are written to disk.  If
core.fsyncObjectFiles is set to true, request the JVM to ensure the
data is written before returning success to the caller of insert.

The option defaults to false because it should be useless on any
filesystem that orders writes and metadata, such as ext3 mounted with
data=ordered (or data=journal).  But it may be useful on some systems
(especially HFS+) where file content may flush to the disk
independently of filesystem structure changes.

Because FileChannel.force(boolean) only claims to ensure data is
written if it was written using the write(ByteBuffer) method of
FileChannel, redirect all writes when using fsyncObjectFiles to go
through the FileChannel interface instead of through the older style
OutputStream interface.  This may not be necessary on all JVMs, but
its more portable to follow the definition than the common behavior.

The lock file protocol relies on the atomic creation of a standardized
name in the parent directory of the file being updated.  Since the
creation is atomic, at most one thread in any process can succeed on
this creation, and all others will fail.  While the lock file exists,
that file is private to the thread that is writing it, and no others
will attempt to read or modify the file.

Consequently the use of the region level locks around the file are
unnecessary, and may actually reduce performance when using NFS, SMB,
or some other sort of remote filesystem that supports locking.

Files bigger than 8 MB (2^23 bytes) tended to overflow the internal
hashtable, as the table was capped in size to 2^17 records.  If a
file contained 2^17 unique data blocks/lines, the table insertion
got stuck in an infinite loop as the able couldn't grow, and there
was no open slot for the new item.

Remove the artifical 2^17 table limit and instead allow the table
to grow to be as big as 2^30.  With a 64 byte block size, this
permits hashing inputs as large as 64 GB.

If the table reaches 2^30 (or cannot be allocated) hashing is
aborted.  RenameDetector no longer tries to break a modify file pair,
and it does not try to match the file for rename or copy detection.

If a file fails to index the first time the loop encounters it, the
file is likely to fail to index again on the next row.  Rather than
wasting a huge amount of CPU to index it again and fail, remember
which destination files failed to index and skip over them on each
subsequent row.

Because this condition is very unlikely, avoid allocating the BitSet
until its actually needed.  This keeps the memory usage unaffected
for the common case.

If the only file added is really small, and all of the deleted
files are really big, none of the permutations will match up due
to the sizes being too far apart to fit the current rename score.

Avoid allocating the really big deleted SimilarityIndex by deferring
its construction until at least one add along that row has a
reasonable chance of matching it.

This avoids expending a lot of CPU time looking at big deleted
binary files when a small modified text file was broken due to a
high percentage of changed lines.

Setting the array elements to -1 is more expensive than relying on
the allocator to zero the array for us first.  Shifting the code to
always add 1 to the size (so an empty file is actually 1 byte long)
allows us to detect an unloaded size by comparing to 0, thus saving
the array fill calls.

The counter portion of each pair is only 32 bits wide, but is part
of a larger 64 bit integer.  If the file size was larger than 4 GB
the counter could overflow and impact the key, changing the hash,
and later resulting in an incorrect similarity score.

Guard against this overflow condition by capping the count for each
record at 2^32-1.  If any record contains more than that many bytes
the table aborts hashing and throws TableFullException.

This permits the index to scan and work on files that exceed 4 GB
in size, but only if the file contains more than one unique block.
The index throws TableFullException on a 4 GB file containing all
zeros, but should succeed on a 6 GB file containing unique lines.

The index now uses a 64 bit accumulator during the common scoring
algorithm, possibly resulting in slower summations.  However this
index is already heavily dependent upon 64 bit integer operations
being efficient, so increasing from 32 bits to 64 bits allows us
to correctly handle 6 GB files.

To keep this simple to review we don't adjust formatting right

We can fix this with a later reformatting change.

fields that must be inherited, at the slight expense of an extra

indirection whenever the options, nameEncoder, or read buffer is
required by the iterator.

the two delta formats, where the delta base must itself be scanned.

IndexPack to use a streaming interface.

Its confusing that a new TreeWalk() needs to have reset() invoked
on it before addTree().  This is a historical accident caused by
how TreeWalk was abused within ObjectWalk.

Drop the initial empty tree from the TreeWalk and thus remove a
number of pointless reset() operations from unit tests and some of
the internal JGit code.

Existing application code which is still calling reset() will simply
be incurring a few unnecessary field assignments, but they should
consider cleaning up their code in the future.

If a treewalk walks also over index and the workingtree then
the IndexWorkingTreeDiff filter can be used which works much
faster then the semantically equivalent ANY_DIFF filter. This
is because this filter can better avoid computing SHA-1 ids
over the content of working-tree files which is very costly.

This fix will significantly improve the performance of e.g.
EGits commit dialog.

To improve runtime performance, caching the WorkingTreeOptions inside
of the Config object using the Config.SectionParser API allows
the WorkingTreeOptions to be accessed more efficiently whenever a
FileTreeIterator is constructed for the Repository.

Instead of passing the filemode handling option into isModified(),
the WorkingTreeIterator should always honor whatever setting has
been configured in this repository, as defined by its own copy of
the WorkingTreeOptions.  This simplifies all of the callers as they
no longer need to lookup core.filemode on their own.

A few locations were changed from always using a hardcoded ""true""
on the file mode to passing what is actually configured in the
repository.  This is a behavior change, but corrects what should be
considered to be bugs as the core.filemode variable wasn't always
being used.

This change is necessary because diff() is slightly broken and is

When comparing the ObjectIds for two tree entries its faster
to use the raw buffer compares over allocating ObjectIds and
then performing equals on their contents.

However, this also needs to consider the raw modes.  It is possible
for a path to change modes but not ObjectId (e.g. making a file
executable), and in this case its still a staged change to report back
to the caller.

Always use streaming (for SHA-checksum & collision detection)
when indexing whole blobs, regardless of their size.

Positives:
* benefits of bugfix #312868 will apply to all runtimes, without
  additional conf for mem-constrained JVMs (5MB huge for some)
* no byte array allocation
  (re-uses readBuffer instead of allocating new full-size array)
* mildly better overall performance
  (given the usual blob-does-not-need-collision-checking case)
* removes unnecessary code

Negative:
* doubles the disk IO for a blob comparision
  (comparitively rare occurance)

I perf-tested a range of threshold sizes against a random selection
of packfiles I found on my harddrive, the results are here:

https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=tLCQElyyd2RKN9QevfvgwGQ&hl=en_GB#gid=1

My interpretation of the results is that the streaming size threshold
isn't beneficial (actually seems to be very slightly detrimental) -so
we should just get rid of it. This tallies with some of the comments
Shawn & I had for the default value of streamFileThreshold in the
review for I862afd4c:

http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#patch,sidebyside,2040,2,org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/IndexPack.java

The perf-test code is here: https://gist.github.com/735402
It's a bit scruffy but basically does 10 runs (in randomised order)
for each threshold size on various packfiles, waiting a second
between each pack-indexing to allow GC to catch up. I know it's not
perfect - proper perf testing is hard to do :-)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is needed to ensure interoperability with the command line: if
the git-rebase-todo file was created manually (by git rebase -i in the
command line), and any commands other than pick are used (reword,
edit, fixup, squash) JGit must abort as it does not understand these

The same is true if an unknown command is found (e.g. due to a typo);
this is the same behavior as shown by the command line.

Each time getConfig() is called on FileRepository, it checks the
last modified time of both ~/.gitconfig and $GIT_DIR?config.  If
$GIT_DIR/config appears to have been modified, it is read back in
from disk and the current config is wiped out.

When mutating a configuration file, this may cause in-memory edits
to disappear.  To avoid that callers need to avoid calling getConfig
until after the configuration has been saved to disk.

Unfortunately the API is still horribly broken.  Configuration should
be modified only while a lock is held on the configuration file, very
similar to the way a ref is updated via its locking protocol.  But our
existing API is really broken for that so we'll have to defer cleaning
up the edit path for a future change.

Merging Git notes branches has several differences from merging ""normal""
branches. Although Git notes are initially stored as one flat tree the
tree may fanout when the number of notes becomes too large for efficient
access. In this case the first two hex digits of the note name will be
used as a subdirectory name and the rest 38 hex digits as the file name
under than directory. Similarly, when number of notes decreases a fanout
tree may collapse back into a flat tree.  The Git notes merge algorithm
must take into account possibly different tree structures in different
note branches and must properly match them against each other.

Any conflict on a Git note is, by default, resolved by concatenating
the two conflicting verions of the note. A delete-edit conflict is, by
default, resolved by keeping the edit version.

The note merge logic is pluggable and the caller may provide custom
note merger that will perform different merging strategy.

Additionally, it is possible to have non-note entries inside a notes
tree. The merge algorithm must also take this fact into account and
will try to merge such non-note entries. However, in case of any merge
conflicts the merge operation will fail. Git notes merge algorithm is
currently not trying to do content merge of non-note entries.

Thanks to Shawn Pierce for patiently answering my questions related to
this topic, giving hints and providing code snippets.

If the 'TREE' extension contains an invalid subtree that has
been removed, DirCacheIterator still tried to access it due to
an invalid childCnt field within the parent DirCacheTree object.
This is easy for a user to do, they just need to move all files
out of a subdirectory.

For example, the input for the JUnit test case for this bug was
built using the following C Git sequence:

  mkdir -p a/b
  touch a/b/c q
  git add a/b/c q
  git write-tree
  git mv a/b/c a/a

After the last step, the subdirectory a/b is empty, as its only
file was moved into the parent directory.  Because of the earlier
`git write-tree` operation, there is a 'TREE' extension present, but
the a and a/b subdirectories have been marked invalid by the rename.

When JGit tried to iterate over the a tree, it tried to correct
childCnt to be zero as a/b no longer exists, but it failed to
update childCnt.

Replace 'method' with 'stack' -based recursion for resolving deltas.
Git packfile delta-chain depth can exceed 50 levels in certain files
(the packfile of the JGit project itself has >800 objects with
chain-length >50). Using method-based recursion on such packfiles
will quickly throw a StackOverflowError on VMs with constrained
stack.

Benefits:
* packfile delta-resolution no longer limited by the maximum number
  of stack frames permitted on the heap
* slight performance improvement
  (2.4% speed increase on the packfile of the JGit project)

I had to introduce a new DeltaVisit object to hold the state on the
java.util.Stack, as obviously there's no appropriate tuple already
available that corresponds to the args of the recursive resolveDelta
methods. The DeltaVisit object is composed in part from new TypedData
and DeltaIdentifier objects which are re-used as appropriate when
following delta-chains, on the grounds that it's better to pass a
single object reference than a pair of references to e.g. an 'int'
and a 'long'. The additonal object allocation hasn't hurt
performance, in fact perf-testing (https://gist.github.com/756740)
shows a small performance improvement:

This completes the extermination of JUnit3. Most of the
work was global searce/replace using regular expression,
followed by numerous invocarions of quick-fix and organize
imports and verification that we had the same number of
tests before and after.

- Annotations were introduced.
- All references to JUnit3 classes removed
- Half-good replacement for getting the test name. This was
  needed to make the TestRngs work. The initialization of
  TestRngs was also made lazily since we can not longer find
  out the test name in runtime in the @Before methods.

  of TestTranslateBundle, which fails from Maven

When an application asks for the names in a section, it may want to
see the existing case that was stored by the user.  For example,
Gerrit Code Review wants to store a configuration block like:

  [access ""refs/heads/master""]
    label-Code-Review = group Developers

and although the name label-Code-Review is case-insensitive, it wants
to display the case as it appeared in the configuration file.

When enumerating section names or variable names (both of which are
case-insensitive), Config now keeps track of the string that first
appeared, and presents them in file order, permitting applications to
use this information.  To maintain case-insensitive behavior, the
contains() method of the returned Set<String> still performs a
case-insensitive compare.

This is a behavior change if the caller enumerates the returned
Set<String> and copies it to his own Set<String>, and then performs
contains() tests against that, as the strings are now the original
case from the configuration block.  But I don't think anyone actually
does this, as the returned sets are immutable and are cached.

repository implementations have a chance to inject their own logic

The API isn't completely generic yet, there are still quite a few
assumptions that the PackParser subclass is storing the data onto
the local filesystem as a single file.  But its about the simplest
split of IndexPack I can come up with without completely ripping

If a pack uses OFS_DELTA only (e.g. its an initial push to a
repository) and PackParser's implementation is broken such that the
delta chain that hangs below a particular object offset is empty, the
entryCount won't match the expected objectCount.  Fail fast rather
than claiming the stream was parsed correctly.

The current implementation is not broken as described above.  I broke
the code when I implemented my own new subclass of PackParser (which
incorrectly mucked with the object offset information), leading me to
discover this consistency check was missing.

Reading a repository for millions of missing objects might be very
expensive to perform, especially if the repository is on a network
filesystem or some other costly RPC backend.  A repository owner
might choose to accept some risk in return for better performance,
so allow disabling collision checking when receiving a pack.

Currently there is no way for an end-user to disable this feature.
This is intentional, because it is generally *NOT* a good idea to
skip this check.  Instead this feature is supplied for storage
implementations to bypass the default checking logic, should they
have their own custom routines that is just as effective but can
be handled more efficiently.

jgit.storage.dht is a new storage provider implementation for JGit
that permits storing the Git repository into a distributed hashtable,
NoSQL system, or traditional database.  The actual underlying storage
system is completely undefined, and can be plugged in by implementing
7 small interfaces:

  *  Database
  *  RepositoryTable
  *  RefTable (and RefTransaction)
  *  ChunkTable
  *  ObjectIndexTable
  *  WriteBuffer

The storage provider interface tries to assume very little about the
underlying storage system, and requires only three key features:

  *  key -> value lookup (a hashtable is suitable)
  *  atomic updates on single rows
  *  asynchronous operations (Java's ExecutorService is easy to use)

Most NoSQL database products offer all 3 of these features in their
clients, and so does any decent network based cache system like the
open source memcache product.  Relying only on key equality for data
retrevial makes it simple for the storage engine to distribute across
multiple machines.  Traditional SQL systems could also be used with a
(yet to be written) JDBC based spi implementation.

Thus far I have implemented two storage systems for the spi layer:
Apache Cassandra [1] and Google Bigtable.  Both systems weigh in with
an spi layer around 1000 lines of code to implement the above 7
interfaces.  This is a huge reduction in size compared to prior
attempts to implement a new JGit storage layer.  As this package
shows, a complete JGit storage implementation is closer to 7000 lines
of relatively complex code.

If HEAD exists but points to an not-existing branch the merge
command should silently create the missing branch and check
it out. This happens if you pull into freshly initalized repo.
HEAD points to refs/heads/master but refs/heads/master doesn't
exist. If you know merge a commit X into HEAD then the branch
master should be created (pointing to X) the working tree should
be updated to reflect X. That is achieved by checkout with one
tree only (HEAD is missing).

A test for this functionality will come the the next proposal
in PullCommandTest.

When DirCacheCheckout was checking out it was silently
overwriting untracked files. This is only ok if the
files are also ignored. Untracked and not ignored files
should not be overwritten. This fix adds checks for
this situation.
Because this change in the behaviour also broke tests
which expected that a checkout will overwrite untracked
files (PullCommandTest) these tests have to be modified
also.

Git standard TOPO ordering as described in JGit commit ba984ba2e0a
(""Fix checkReferencedIsReachable to use correct base list"").

Switching to COMMIT_TIME_DESC when there are no uninteresting commits
allows the ""Counting objects"" phase to emit progress earlier, as the
RevWalk will not buffer the commit list.  When TOPO is set the RevWalk
enumerates all commits first, before outputing any for PackWriter to
mark progress updates from.

Counting the objects needed for packing is the most expensive part of
an UploadPack request that has no uninteresting objects (otherwise
known as an initial clone).  During this phase the PackWriter is
enumerating the entire set of objects in this repository, so they can
be sent to the client for their new clone.

Allow the ObjectReader (and therefore the underlying storage system)
to keep a cached list of all reachable objects from a small number of
points in the project's history.  If one of those points is reached
during enumeration of the commit graph, most objects are obtained from
the cached list instead of direct traversal.

PackWriter uses the list by discarding the current object lists and
restarting a traversal from all refs but marking the object list name
as uninteresting.  This allows PackWriter to enumerate all objects
that are more recent than the list creation, or that were on side
branches that the list does not include.

However, ObjectWalk tags all of the trees and commits within the list
commit as UNINTERESTING, which would normally cause PackWriter to
construct a thin pack that excludes these objects.  To avoid that,
addObject() was refactored to allow this list-based enumeration to
always include an object, even if it has been tagged UNINTERESTING by
the ObjectWalk.  This implies the list-based enumeration may only be
used for initial clones, where all objects are being sent.

The UNINTERESTING labeling occurs because StartGenerator always
enables the BoundaryGenerator if the walker is an ObjectWalk and a
commit was marked UNINTERESTING, even if RevSort.BOUNDARY was not
enabled.  This is the default reasonable behavior for an ObjectWalk,
but isn't desired here in PackWriter with the list-based enumeration.
Rather than trying to change all of this behavior, PackWriter works
around it.

Because the list name commit's immediate files and trees were all
enumerated before the list enumeration itself starts (and are also
within the list itself) PackWriter runs the risk of adding the same
objects to its ObjectIdSubclassMap twice.  Since this breaks the
internal map data structure (and also may cause the object to transmit
twice), PackWriter needs to use a new ""added"" RevFlag to track whether
or not an object has been put into the outgoing list yet.

I regret adding this feature to the public API.  Caches aren't always
the best idea, as they require work to maintain.  Here the cache is
redundant information that must be computed, and when it grows stale
must be removed.  The redundant information takes up more disk space,
about the same size as the pack-*.idx files are.  For the linux-2.6
repository, that's more than 40 MB for a 400 MB repository.  So the
cache is a 10% increase in disk usage.

The entire point of this cache is to improve PackWriter performance,
and only PackWriter performance, and only when sending an initial
clone to a new client.  There may be better ways to optimize this, and
until we have a solid solution, we shouldn't be using a separate cache

Non-commits are added to a pending queue, but duplicates are

stripped off the old roots, otherwise the caller cannot reuse
the old roots after the reset.

RevWalk already does this correctly for commits, but ObjectWalk

CGit push clients 1.6.6 and later support progress messages on the
side-band-64k channel during push, as this was introduced to handle
server side hook errors reported over smart HTTP.

Since JGit's delta resolution isn't always as fast as CGit's is,
a user may think the server has crashed and failed to report
status if the user pushed a lot of content and sees no feedback.
Exposing the progress monitor during the resolving deltas phase
will let the user know the server is still making forward progress.

This also helps BasePackPushConnection, which has a bounded timeout
on how long it will wait before assuming the remote server is dead.
Progress messages pushed down the side-band channel will reset the
read timer, helping the connection to stay alive and avoid timing
out before the remote side's work is complete.

There is no point in pushing all of the files within the edge
commits into the delta search when making a thin pack.  This floods
the delta search window with objects that are unlikely to be useful
bases for the objects that will be written out, resulting in lower
data compression and higher transfer sizes.

Instead observe the path of a tree or blob that is being pushed
into the outgoing set, and use that path to locate up to WINDOW
ancestor versions from the edge commits.  Push only those objects
into the edgeObjects set, reducing the number of objects seen by the
search window.  This allows PackWriter to only look at ancestors
for the modified files, rather than all files in the project.
Limiting the search to WINDOW size makes sense, because more than
WINDOW edge objects will just skip through the window search as
none of them need to be delta compressed.

To further improve compression, sort edge objects into the front
of the window list, rather than randomly throughout.  This puts
non-edges later in the window and gives them a better chance at
finding their base, since they search backwards through the window.

These changes make a significant difference in the thin-pack:

The most expensive part of packing a repository for transport to
another system is enumerating all of the objects in the repository.
Once this gets to the size of the linux-2.6 repository (1.8 million
objects), enumeration can take several CPU minutes and costs a lot
of temporary working set memory.

Teach PackWriter to efficiently reuse an existing ""cached pack""
by answering a clone request with a thin pack followed by a larger
cached pack appended to the end.  This requires the repository
owner to first construct the cached pack by hand, and record the
tip commits inside of $GIT_DIR/objects/info/cached-packs:

  cd $GIT_DIR
  root=$(git rev-parse master)
  tmp=objects/.tmp-$$
  names=$(echo $root | git pack-objects --keep-true-parents --revs $tmp)
  for n in $names; do
    chmod a-w $tmp-$n.pack $tmp-$n.idx
    touch objects/pack/pack-$n.keep
    mv $tmp-$n.pack objects/pack/pack-$n.pack
    mv $tmp-$n.idx objects/pack/pack-$n.idx
  done

  (echo ""+ $root"";
   for n in $names; do echo ""P $n""; done;
   echo) >>objects/info/cached-packs

  git repack -a -d

When a clone request needs to include $root, the corresponding
cached pack will be copied as-is, rather than enumerating all of
the objects that are reachable from $root.

For a linux-2.6 kernel repository that should be about 376 MiB,
the above process creates two packs of 368 MiB and 38 MiB[1].
This is a local disk usage increase of ~26 MiB, due to reduced
delta compression between the large cached pack and the smaller
recent activity pack.  The overhead is similar to 1 full copy of
the compressed project sources.

With this cached pack in hand, JGit daemon completes a clone request
in 1m17s less time, but a slightly larger data transfer (+2.39 MiB):

Repository owners can periodically refresh their cached packs by
repacking their repository, folding all newer objects into a larger
cached pack.  Since repacking is already considered to be a normal
Git maintenance activity, this isn't a very big burden.

It isn't strictly necessary to validate every reference's target
object is reachable in the repository before advertising it to a
client. This is an expensive operation when there are thousands of
references, and its very unlikely that a reference uses a missing
object, because garbage collection proceeds from the references and
walks down through the graph. So trying to hide a dangling reference
from clients is relatively pointless.

Even if we are trying to avoid giving a client a corrupt repository,
this simple check isn't sufficient.  It is possible for a reference to
point to a valid commit, but that commit to have a missing blob in its
root tree.  This can be caused by staging a file into the index,
waiting several weeks, then committing that file while also racing
against a prune.  The prune may delete the blob, since its
modification time is more than 2 weeks ago, but retain the commit,
since its modification time is right now.

Such graph corruption is already caught during PackWriter as it
enumerates the graph from the client's want list and digs back
to the roots or common base.  Leave the reference validation also
for that same phase, where we know we have to parse the object to
support the enumeration.

If a client wants to perform a clone of the repository, it sends
wants, but no haves.  There is no point in parsing the want list
within UploadPack, as there won't be a common merge base search.
Instead just defer the parsing to PackWriter, which will do its
own parsing and object enumeration.

If the client does have a ""have"" set, defer parsing of the want list
until the have list is also parsed, and parse them together in a
single batch queue.  This lets the underlying storage system use a
larger lookup batch if there is significant latency involved when
resolving an ObjectId to a RevObject.

wantAll() is looking for an object where wantSatisfied() returns
false, because there is no common merge base present.  Unfortunately
it was missing a !, causing the loop to break and return false after
at least one want was satisified.

When the walker resets, its going to scrub the COMMON and SATISIFIED
flags off a commit if the commit is contained within another commit
the client wants.  This is common if the client asks for both a
'maint' and 'master' branch, and 'maint' is also fully merged into
'master'.

COMMON shouldn't be scrubbed during reset because its used to control
membership of the commonBase collection, which is a List.  commonBase
should technically be a set, but membership is cheaper with a RevFlag.
COMMON appears on a commit reachable from a WANT when there is also a
PEER_HAS flag present, as this is a merge base.  Scrubbing this off
when another branch is tested isn't useful.

SATISIFIED is a cache to tell us if wantSatisified() has already
completed for this particular WANT.  If it has, there isn't a need to
recompute on that branch.  Scrubbing it off 'maint' when we test
'master' just means we would later need to re-test 'maint', wasting
CPU time on the server.

If the client presents a common commit on a side branch, and there is
a want for a disconnected branch UploadPack was walking back on the
entire history of the disconnected branch because it never would find
the common commit.

Limit our search back along any given want to be no earlier than the
oldest common commit received via a ""have"" line from our client.  This
prevents us from looking at all of the project history.

When negotiate() starts there is at least one want, but no haves, and
thus no common base exists.  Its not ok to give up yet, the client
should try to find a common base with the server.  Avoid scanning our
history along the want chains until we have found at least one commit
in common with the client, this will trigger okToGiveUp to be set to
null, enabling okToGiveUp() to perform the scan.

When UploadPack has computed the merge base between the client's have
set and the want set, its already loaded and parsed all of the
interesting commits that PackWriter needs to transmit to the client.
Switching the RevWalk and its object pool over to be an ObjectWalk
saves PackWriter from needing to re-parse these same commits from the
ObjectDatabase, reducing the startup latency for the enumeration
phase of packing.

UploadPack doesn't want to use an ObjectWalk for the okToGiveUp()
tests because its slower, during each commit popped it needs to cache
the tree into the pendingObjects list, and during each reset() it
discards a bunch of ObjectWalk specific state and reallocates some
internal collections.  ObjectWalk was never meant to be rapidly
reset() like UploadPack does, so its perhaps somewhat cleaner to allow
""upgrading"" a RevWalk to an ObjectWalk.

Applications like UploadPack reset() and reuse the same RevWalk
multiple times in very rapid succession.  Releasing the ObjectReader's
internal state on each use, only to allocate it again on the next
cycle kills performance if the ObjectReader has internal caches, or
even if the Inflater gets returned and pulled from the InflaterCache
too frequently.

Making releasing the ObjectReader the application's responsibility
when it is done with the RevWalk, which most already do by wrapping
their loop in a try/finally block.

Using a resolver and factory pattern for the anonymous git:// Daemon
class makes transport.Daemon more useful on non-file storage systems,
or in embedded applications where the caller wants more precise
control over the work tasks constructed within the daemon.

Rather than defining new interfaces, move the existing HTTP ones
into transport.resolver and make them generic on the connection
handle type.  For HTTP, continue to use HttpServletRequest, and
for transport.Daemon use DaemonClient.

To remain compatible with transport.Daemon, FileResolver needs to
learn how to use multiple base directories, and how to export any
Repository instance at a fixed name.

In this particular case however it doesn't.  Its the reverse proxy

Use a more standard method of parsing by splitting the value into

As PackParser supports a progress meter for the ""Resolving deltas""

they know the server is still working on their (large) upload.

However this isn't as simple as just dropping in a binding for
the SmartOutputStream to flush when its told to.  We want to
avoid spurious flushes triggered by the use of sideband, or the

RevWalk in JGit and the revision code in C Git both parse commits out
of the pack file in an order that differs from strict timestamp and
topological sorting.  Both implementations pop a commit from the head
of a date queue, and then immediately parse all of its parents in
order to insert those into the date queue at the proper positions as
determined by their committer timestamp field.  This implies that the
parents are parsed when their most recent child is popped from the
queue, and not where they are popped during traversal.

Hoisting a parent commit to be immediately behind its child improves
locality by making sure all parents of a merge are clustered together,
and thus can be paged into the parser by the pack file buffering
system (aka WindowCache in JGit) together.

CGit just learned to always use OFS_DELTA when writing out bundle
files.  This makes sense because bundle came about well after
OFS_DELTA was established, so any version of CGit that can read a
bundle file can also read OFS_DELTA.  Since OFS_DELTA is smaller,
always use it when writing bundles.

If the underlying storage has a high latency per SHA-1 lookup
(e.g. the DHT support we are working on), parsing each wanted
annotated tag object back to its underlying commit is too slow,
its a sequential lookup for each tag.  With hundreds of tags in
a repository this takes far too long.

Instead queue up a list of the tags whose objects need to be found,
and then locate all of those in one parseAny batch.  This works
for the common case of annotated tag to single tree or commit.
For the less often used tag->tag->commit, it at least gets us
one level parsed in the larger batch before we have to go back to
sequential lookups.

Many source browsers and network related tools like UploadPack need
to find and parse the target of all branches and annotated tags
within the repository during their startup phase.  Clustering these
together into the same part of the pack file will improve locality,
reducing thrashing when an application starts and needs to load
all of these into memory at once.

To prevent bottlenecking basic log viewing tools that are scannning
backwards from the tip of a current branch (and don't need tags)
we place this cluster of older targets after 4096 newer commits
have already been placed into the pack stream.  4096 was chosen as
a rough guess, but was based on a few factors:

  - log viewers typically show 5-200 commits per page
  - users only view the first page or two

  - DHT can cram 2200-4000 commits per 1 MiB chunk
    thus these will fall into the second commit chunk (roughly)

Unfortunately this placement hurts history tools that are scanning
backwards through the commit graph and completely ignored tags or
branch heads when they started.

An ancient tagged commit is no longer positioned behind its first
child (its now much earlier), resulting in a page fault for the
parser to reload this cluster of objects on demand.  This may be
an acceptable loss.  If a user is walking backwards and has already
scanned through more than 4096 commits of history, waiting for the
region to reload isn't really that bad compared to the amount of
time already spent.

If the repository is so small that there are less than 4096 commits,
this change has no impact on the placement of objects.

We did not record the time spent on the object reuse search or the
object size lookup, both of which occur between the counting phase and
the compressing phase.  If there are enough objects involved, these
times can be significant so its worth timing them and recording it.

The new RemoteCommandConnection class replaces
TransportGitSsh.Connection, which has been removed. Also added
RemoteCommandConnectionFactory class.  Callers can set this factory
with TransportGitSsh.setConnectionFactory.  (In
TransportGitSsh.newConnection, this factory is used before the
previous methods if it has been set.)

Minor changes were made to TransportGitSsh to use the new class, such
as easing some access restrictions. Some interface changes were made
as well. Both RemoteCommandConnection.exec and .connection now expect
the URI. (Note the parameter name change from ""uri"" to ""uriLocal
inside JschConnection and ExtConnection to prevent clashing with
TransportGitSsh.uri.) More importantly, exec now expects the exact
command to be executed.  Previously, JschConnection and ExtConnection
had to call ""commandFor"" to complete the command. Now the commandFor
is executed by TransportGitSsh before calling exec.

We attempted to pull out JschConnection from TransportGitSsh but ran
into a dependency problem for the ""sock"" variable, which is the Jsch
session from TransportGitSsh. To fix this dependency would require
creating a session abstraction, such as an abstract
""RemoteCommandSession"" class. But even if we added an abstract
interface for sock than the SftpObjectDB in sftp transport would
still be Jsch dependent, because it uses the ChannelSftp. Thus to
allow other ssh libraries SftpObjectDB has to be made an abstract
class the same way as this patch introduces the abstract
RemoteCommandConnection.

JDK7 changed behavior slightly on some InputStream types, resulting in
the first read being shorter than the count requested.  That caused us
to overwrite the earlier part of the buffer with later data, as the
offset index wasn't updated in the loop.

Fix the loop to increment offset by the number of bytes read in this
iteration, so the next read appends to the buffer rather than doing an
overwrite.

Instead of polling the system clock on every update(1) method call,
use a scheduled executor to toggle a volatile once per second until
the task is done.  Check the volatile on each update(int), looking
to see if output should occur.

This limits progress output to either once per 1% complete, or once
per second.  To save time during update calls the timer isn't reset
during each 1% of output, which means we may see one unnecessary
output trigger if at least 1% completed during the one second of the
alarm time.

This is a tiny optimization to how delta search works.  Checking for
isReuseAsIs() avoids doing delta compression search on non-delta
objects already stored in packs within the repository.  Such objects
are not likely to be delta compressable, as they were already delta
searched when their containing pack was generated and they were
not delta compressed at that time.  Doing delta compression now is
unlikely to produce a different result, but would waste a lot of CPU.

The isReuseAsIs() flag is checked before isDoNotDelta() because it
is very common to reuse objects in the output pack.  Most objects
get reused, and only a handful have the isDoNotDelta() bit set.
Moving the check earlier allows the loop to more quickly skip
through objects that will never need to be considered.

JGit doesn't generate deltas for commit or tag objects when it packs
a repository from scratch.  This is an explicit design decision that
is (mostly) justified by the fact that these objects do not delta
compress well.

Annotated tags are made once on stable points of the project history,
it is unlikely they will ever appear again with sufficient common
text to justify using a delta over just deflating the raw content.
JGit never tries to delta compress annotated tags and I take the
stance that these are best stored as non-deltas given how frequently
they might be accessed by repository viewers.

Commits only have sufficient common text when they are cherry-picked
to forward-port or back-port a change from one branch to another.
Even in these cases the distance between the commits as returned
by the log traversal has to be small enough that they would both
appear in the delta search window at the same time in order to
delta compress one of the messages against the other.  JGit never
tries to delta compress commits, as it requires a lot of CPU time
but typically does not produce a smaller pack file.

Avoid reusing deltas for either of these types when constructing a
new pack.  To avoid killing performance during serving of network
clients, UploadPack disables this code change by allowing PackWriter
to reuse delta commits.  Repositories that were already repacked by
C Git will not have their delta commits decompressed and recompressed
on the fly during object writing, saving server-side CPU resources.

Annotated tags need to be parsed by many viewing tools, but putting
them at the end of the pack hurts because kernel prefetching might
not have loaded them, since they are so far from the commits they
reference.

Position tags right behind the commits, but before the trees.
Typically the annotated tag set for a repository is very small,
so the extra prefetch burden it puts on tools that don't need
annotated tags (but do need commits and trees) is fairly low.

There is no need to validate the object contents during
copyObjectAsIs if the result is going to be parsed by unpack-objects
or index-pack.  Both programs will compute the SHA-1 of the object,
and also validate most of the pack structure.  For git daemon
like servers, this work is already done on the client end of the
connection, so the server doesn't need to repeat that work itself.

Disable object validation for the 3 transport cases where we know
the remote side will handle object validation for us (push, bundle
creation, and upload pack).  This improves performance on the server
side by reducing the work that must be done.

If object reuse validation is enabled, the output pack is going to
probably be stored locally.  When reusing an existing cached pack
to save object enumeration costs, ensure the cached pack has not
been corrupted by checking its SHA-1 trailer.  If it has, writing
will abort and the output pack won't be complete.  This prevents
anyone from trying to use the output pack, and catches corruption
before it can be carried any further.

Applications may already have a Ref or ObjectId on hand that they want
the remote to be updated to.  Instead of converting these into a
String and relying on the parsing rules of resolve(), allow the
application to supply the Ref or ObjectId directly.

When parsing a string such as ""foo-gbed2"" resolve() was assuming the
suffix was from git describe output.  This lead to JGit trying to find
the completion for the object abbreviation ""bed2"", rather than using
the current value of the reference.  If there was only one such object
in the repository, JGit might actually use the wrong value here, as
resolve() would return the completion of the abbreviation ""bed2""
rather than the current value of the reference ""refs/heads/foo-gbed2"".

Move the parsing of git describe abbreviations out of the operator
portion of the resolve() method and into the simple portion that is
supposed to handle only object ids or reference names, and only do the
describe parsing after all other approaches have already failed to
provide a resolution.

Add new unit tests to verify the behavior is as expected by users.

Instead of resizing an ArrayList until all objects have been added,
append objects into a specialized List type that uses small arrays
of 1024 entries for each 1024 objects added.

For a large repository like linux-2.6, PackWriter will now allocate
1,758 smaller arrays to hold the object list, without creating any
garbage from the intermediate states due to list expansion.

1024 was chosen as the block size (and initial directory size) as this
is a reasonable balance for the PackWriter code.  Each block uses
approximately 4096 bytes in a 32 bit JVM, as does the default top
level block directory.  The top level directory doesn't expand until 1
million items have been added to the list, which for linux-2.6 won't
yet occur as the lists are per-object-type and are thus bounded to
about 1/3 of 1.8 million.

Default the initial size to 2048. This cuts out 6 expansions in
the early life of the table, reducing garbage and rehashing time.

Ensure the JIT knows the table cannot be changed during the critical
inner loop of get() or insert() by loading the field into a final
local variable.  This shouldn't be necessary, but the instance member
is declared non-final (to resizing) and it is not very obvious to the
JIT that the table cannot be modified by AnyObjectId.equals().

Simplify the JIT's decision making by making it obvious, these
values cannot change during the critical inner loop, allowing
for better register allocation.

of a conditional with a branch.  This is generally faster due to one

OwnerMap is about 200 ms faster than SubclassMap, more friendly to the
GC, and uses less storage: testing the ""Counting objects"" part of
PackWriter on 1886362 objects:

  ObjectIdSubclassMap:
    load factor 50%
    table: 4194304 (wasted 2307942)
    ms spent 36998 36009 34795 34703 34941 35070 34284 34511 34638 34256
    ms avg 34800 (last 9 runs)

  ObjectIdOwnerMap:
    load factor 100%
    table: 2097152 (wasted 210790)
    directory: 1024
    ms spent 36842 35112 34922 34703 34580 34782 34165 34662 34314 34140
    ms avg 34597 (last 9 runs)

The major difference with OwnerMap is entries must extend from
ObjectIdOwnerMap.Entry, where the OwnerMap has injected its own
private ""next"" field into each object. This allows the OwnerMap to use
a singly linked list for chaining collisions within a bucket. By
putting collisions in a linked list, we gain the entire table back for
the SHA-1 bits to index their own ""private"" slot.

Unfortunately this means that each object can appear in at most ONE
OwnerMap, as there is only one ""next"" field within the object instance
to thread into the map. For types that are very object map heavy like
RevWalk (entity RevObject) and PackWriter (entity ObjectToPack) this
is sufficient, these entity types are only put into one map by their
container.  By introducing a new map type, we don't break existing
applications that might be trying to use ObjectIdSubclassMap to track
RevCommits they obtained from a RevWalk.

The OwnerMap uses less memory. Each object uses 1 reference more (so
we're up 1886362 references), but the table is 1/2 the size (2^20
rather than 2^21). The table itself wastes only 210790 slots, rather
than 2307942. So we're wasting around 200k fewer references in total.

OwnerMap is more friendly to the GC, because it hardly ever generates
garbage. As the map reaches its 100% load factor target, it doubles in
size by allocating additional segment arrays of 2048 entries. (So the
first grow allocates 1 segment, second 2 segments, third 4 segments,
etc.)  These segments are hooked into the pre-allocated directory of
1024 spaces. This permits the map to grow to 2 million objects before
the directory itself has to grow. By using segments of 2048 entries,
we are asking the GC to acquire 8,204 bytes in a 32 bit JVM. This is
easier to satisfy then 2,307,942 bytes (for the 512k table that is
just an intermediate step in the SubclassMap). By reusing the
previously allocated segments (they are re-hashed in-place) we don't
release any memory during a table grow.

When the directory grows, it does so by discarding the old one and
using one that is 4x larger (so the directory goes to 4096 entries on
its first grow). A directory of size 4096 can handle up to 8 millon
objects. The second directory grow (16384) goes to 33 million objects.
At that point we're starting to really push the limits of the JVM
heap, but at least its many small arrays. Previously SubclassMap would
need a table of 67108864 entries to handle that object count, which
needs a single contiguous allocation of 256 MiB. That's hard to come
by in a 32 bit JVM. Instead OwnerMap uses ~8192 arrays of about 2 MiB
each. This should be much easier to fit into a fragmented heap.

PackWriter incorrectly returned 0 from getObjectsNumber() when the
pack has not been written yet. This caused dumb transports like
amazon-s3:// and sftp:// to abort early and never write out a pack,
under the assumption that the pack had no objects.

Until the pack header is written to the output stream, compute the
current object count each time it is requested. Once the header is
started, use the object count from the stats object.

If the client is only following the remote repository and has not
created any new non-common commits, the client will wind up sending
a ""have %s"" line for each tag in the repository.  For some projects
like git.git, this is 339 tags and growing, resulting in more than
16 KiB needing to be POSTed over 12 HTTP requests.

Teach UploadPack (server side) to always execute the okToGiveUp()
logic at least once per negotiation round to determine if the server
can compute a pack right now.  If it can, shove in an ""ACK %s ready""
message to tell the client this and try to prevent receiving ancient
tags in future negotiation rounds.

Teach BasePackFetchConnection (client side) to honor a ""ACK %s ready""
from the remote and break out of its SEND_HAVE loop once the remote
knows it can create a pack.  This avoids sending the remaining 307
tags of git.git.

These two changes together reduce the number of HTTP RPCs from 13
down to 3 in order to fetch from git.git over smart HTTP.  If either
side is missing the change, the older behavior (and its 13 RPCs)
is used.

Native Git clients may request both multi_ack_detailed and no-done
in the same request to prevent the client from needing to send a
""done"" line to the server in response to a server's ""ACK %s ready"".

For smart HTTP, this can save 1 full HTTP RPC in the fetch exchange,
improving overall latency when incrementally updating a client that
has not diveraged very far from the remote repository.

When fetching from a remote peer, consider all of the refs of any
alternate repository to be reachable locally, in addition to the refs
of the local repository.  This mirrors the push protocol and may avoid
unnecessary object transfer when the local repository is empty, but
its alternate and the remote share a lot of common history.

Junio C Hamano recently proposed a similar change to C Git's fetch
client, in order to work around a performance bug I identified when
fetching between two repositories that actually shared the same
alternate repository on the local system.

During object enumeration for the thin pack, very few objects come
out that are duplicated with the cached pack. Typically these are
only cases where a blob or tree was cherry-picked forward, got a
copy or rename, or was reverted... all relatively infrequent events.

Speed up pruning of the thin pack object list by combining the phase
with the object representation selection. Implementers should already
be offering to reuse the object from the cached pack if it is stored
there, at which point the implementation can perform a very fast type
of containment test using the cached pack's identity rather than yet
another index lookup.  For the local disk case this is probably not a
big improvement, but it does help on the DHT implementation where the
two passes combined into one reduces latency.

If the total number of objects to look for reuse on is under 4096
this is really close to a reasonable batch size for the DHT storage
system to lookup at once.  Combine all of the objects into a single
temporary list, perform reuse, and then prune the main lists if any
duplicate objects were detected from a selected CachedPack.

The intention here is to try and avoid 4 tiny sequential lookups
on the storage system when the time to wait for each of those to
finish is higher than the CPU time required to build (and later
GC) this temporary list.

Take a very simple approach to avoiding delta chains during object
reuse: objects are now always selected from the oldest pack that
contains them.  This prevents cycles because a pack must not have
a cycle in the delta chain.  If both objects A and B are chosen
out of the same source pack then there cannot be an A->B->A cycle.

The oldest pack is also the most likely to have the smallest deltas.
Its the biggest pack in the system and probably came from the clone
(or last GC) of this repository, where all objects were previously
considered and packed tightly together.  If an object appears again
(for example due to a revert and a push into this repository) the
newer copy of won't be nearly as small as the older delta version
of it, even if the newer one is also itself a delta.

ObjectDirectory already enumerates objects during selection in this
newest->oldest order, so it already is supplying these assumptions
to PackWriter.  Taking advantage of this can speed up selection by
a tiny amount by avoiding some tests, but can also help to prevent
a cycle needing to be broken on the fly during writing.

The previous cycle breaking logic wasn't fully correct either.
If a different delta base was chosen, the new delta base might not
have been written into the output pack before the current object,
forcing the use of REF_DELTA when OFS_DELTA is always smaller.
This logic has now been reworked to always re-check the delta base
and ensure it gets written before the current object.

If a cycle occurs, it gets broken the same way as before, by
disabling delta reuse and finding an alternative form of the
object, which may require inflating/deflating in whole format.

There is the chance that RefDirectory (our only implementation of the
RefDatabase) doesn't notice updates to refs and therefore reports
outdated data. The problem is that RefDirectory caches LooseRef's
and relies on the filesystems lastModified data to detect whether
the ref has changed. If we manage to update a ref once and afterwards
update the ref externally (e.g. by a push operation) within one second
we may fail to detect this ref update on linux. Egit's
PusOperationTest.pushTest() was very unstable on linux without
explicit sleeps.
This change adds the possibility to clear all caches in RefDirectory
in case you know that you may run into this problem. If you are
writing tests against the JGit API which includes transports
(causing 'external' updates of refs) you wan't to clear the
cache of a receiving repo after a push.

Detaching HEAD didn't work in some corner checkout cases.  If, for example,
HEAD is symbolic ref to refs/heads/master, refs/heads/master is ref to commit
c0ffee... then:

    checkout c0ffee...

would leave the HEAD unchanged.

The same symptom occurs when checking out a remote tracking branch or a tag
that references the same commit as refs/heads/master.

In the above case, the RefUpdate class didn't have enough information to decide
if the update needed to detach symbolic ref because it dealt only with new/old
objectIDs. Therefore, this fix introduced the RefUpdate.detachingSymbolicRef
flag.

Add handling of CHERRY_PICK_HEAD file in .git (similar to MERGE_HEAD),
which is written in case of a conflicting cherry-pick merge.

It is used so that Repository.getRepositoryState can return the new
states CHERRY_PICKING and CHERRY_PICKING_RESOLVED. These states, as well
as CHERRY_PICK_HEAD can be used in EGit to properly show the merge tool.

Also, in case of a conflict, MERGE_MSG is written with the original
commit message and a ""Conflicts"" section appended. This way, the
cherry-picked message is not lost and can later be re-used in the commit
dialog.

RefDirectory did not correctly follow the contract of RefList.  The
contract says if you use add() method of RefList builder, you MUST
sort() it afterwards, and later every other method assumes that list
is properly sorted (especially the binary search in the find() and
get() methods).  Instead RefDirectory class tried to scan the refs
recursively while sorting every folder in the process before
processing and did not call sort().

For example, when scanning the contents of refs/tags project1 string
is smaller than project1-*, so it will recursively go into the folder
and add these tags first and only then will add project-* ones. This
will result in a broken list (any project1-* string is less than
project1/* one, but they all appear after them in the list), that's
why binary search will fail making loose RefList and the whole local
RefMap completely unusable.

Performance testing has indicated the per-process ChunkCache isn't
very effective for the DHT storage implementation.  If a server is
using the DHT storage backend, it is most likely part of a larger
cluster where requests are distributed in a round-robin fashion
between the member servers.

In such a scenario there is insufficient data locality between
requests to get a good hit ratio on the per-process ChunkCache.  A low
hit ratio means the cache is actually hurting performance by eating up
memory that could otherwise be used for transient request data, and
increasing pressure on the GC when it needs to find free space.

Remove all of the ChunkCache code.  Installations that want to cache
(to reduce database usage) should wrap their Database with a
CacheDatabase and use a network based CacheServer.

I left the ChunkCache in the original DHT storage commit because I
wanted to document in the history of the project that its probably
worth *not* having, but leave open a door for someone to revert this
change if they find otherwise at a later date.

Previously when merging two contents with a non-empty base and one of
the contents was empty (size == 0) and the other was modified there
was a potentially expensive calculation until we finally always come
to the same result -> the complete non-deleted content should collide
with the empty content.

This proposal adds an optimization to detect empty input content and
to produce the appropriate result immediatly.

Since this change may affect performance and memory consumption on every
access to a loose ref I explicitly made it a RFC to collect opinions. 

Previously RefDirectory.scanRef() was not detecting an update of a
loose ref when the update didn't changed the modification time of 
the backing file. RefDirectory cached loose refs and the way to detect
outdated cache entries was to compare lastmodification timestamp on the
file representing the ref. If two updates to the same ref happen faster
than the filesystem-timer granularity (for linux this is 2 seconds)
there is the possiblity that we don't detect the update.

Because of this bug EGit's PushOperationTest only works with 2 second
sleeps inside.

This change let RefDirectory use FileSnapshot to detect such situations.
FileSnapshot helps to remember when a file was last read from disk and
therefore enables to decide when to load a file from disk although
modification time has not changed.

RefData now uses a sequence number as part of the field, ensuring
that updates always increase the sequence number by one whenever
a reference is modified.

Attaching a sequence number to RefData will help with storing
reference log entries during updates. As the sequence number should
be unique within the reference name space, log entries can be keyed
by the sequence number and remain unique.  Making this work over
reference delete-create cycles will require an additional RefTable
API to return the oldest sequence number previously used in the
reference log to seed the recreated reference.

Some servlet containers require the servlet to read the EOF marker
from the input stream before a response can be output if the stream
is using ""Transfer-Encoding: chunked""... which is typical for any
sort of large push to a repository over smart HTTP.

Ensure the EOF is always read by the PackParser when it is handling
the stream, and fail fast if there is more data present than expected
since this does indicate a protocol error.

Also ensure the EOF is read by UploadPack before it starts to output
a partial response using packing progress meters.

There is no reason for this type to contain an ArrayList and try to
hide the implementation. It only slows down execution by adding an
extra layer of method dispatch to each invocation.

Instead subclass from ArrayList.

BlameGenerator digs through history and discovers the origin of each
line of some result file.  BlameResult consumes the stream of regions
created by the generator and lays them out in a table for applications
to display alongside of source lines.

Applications may optionally push in the working tree copy of a file
using the push(String, byte[]) method, allowing the application to
receive accurate line annotations for the working tree version.  Lines
that are uncommitted (difference between HEAD and working tree) will
show up with the description given by the application as the author,
or ""Not Committed Yet"" as a default string.

Applications may also run the BlameGenerator in reverse mode using the
reverse(AnyObjectId, AnyObjectId) method instead of push().  When
running in the reverse mode the generator annotates lines by the
commit they are removed in, rather than the commit they were added in.
This allows a user to discover where a line disappeared from when they
are looking at an older revision in the repository.  For example:

  blame --reverse 16e810b2..master -L 1080, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/RefDirectoryTest.java
           (                                              1080)   }
  2302a6d3 (Christian Halstrick 2011-05-20 11:18:20 +0200 1081)
  2302a6d3 (Christian Halstrick 2011-05-20 11:18:20 +0200 1082)   /**
  2302a6d3 (Christian Halstrick 2011-05-20 11:18:20 +0200 1083)    * Kick the timestamp of a local file.

Above we learn that line 1080 (a closing curly brace of the prior
method) still exists in branch master, but the Javadoc comment below
it has been removed by Christian Halstrick on May 20th as part of
commit 2302a6d3.  This result differs considerably from that of C
Git's blame --reverse feature.  JGit tells the reader which commit
performed the delete, while C Git tells the reader the last commit
that still contained the line, leaving it an exercise to the reader
to discover the descendant that performed the removal.

This is still only a basic implementation.  Quite notably it is
missing support for the smart block copy/move detection that the C
implementation of `git blame` is well known for.  Despite being
incremental, the BlameGenerator can only be run once.  After the
generator runs it cannot be reused.  A better implementation would
support applications browsing through history efficiently.

In regards to CQ 5110, only a little of the original code survives.

This is a first simple implementation.
It's been helpful in the diagnostic of bug #347885.
Note that changes to CLIText.properties are not mingled with other
lines in order to respect alphabetical order.
If that's really important we can certainly apply sorting to my changes.
However it's nice to keep them together because some padding alignment
needs to be done across some of them. If later on one needs to change a
label, other labels will need to be changed accordingly so that padding
is respected.
Changes to CLIText.java are also kept together. It's less important to
keep them together in that file, but did so just because I kept them
together in the twin properties file.
Finally, it would be nice to also print the current branch like native
'git status'. However being new to git/egit/jgit I wasn't sure of
certain corner cases (headless state, etc.) so I preferred not adding
that feature. I'm sure someone else can easily add this.

Originally I put the first two digits of the object SHA-1 into the
start of a row key to try and spread the load of objects around a DHT
service. Unfortunately this tends to not work as well as I had hoped.

Servers reading a repository need to contact every node in a DHT
cluster if the cluster tries to evenly distribute the object rows.
This is a lot of connections, especially if the cluster has many
backend storage servers.  If the library has an open connection
limit (possibly due to JVM file descriptor limitations) it may need
to open and close a lot of connections to access a repository,
rather than being able to reuse the same connection to a handful
of backend servers.  This results in a lot of connection thrashing
for some DHT type databases, and is inefficient.

Some DHTs are able to operate even if part of the database space
is currently unavailable.  For example, a DHT service might assign
some section of the key space to a node, and then fail that section
over to another node when the primary is noticed as being offline.
During that failover period that section of the key space is not
available, but other sections hosted by other backends are still
ready for service. Spreading keys all over the cluster makes it
likely that any single backend being temporarily down means the
entire cluster is down, rather than only some.

This is a massive schema change, but it should improve relability
and performance for any DHT system.

The RecentChunks cache assumes there is always at least one recent
chunk in the maxSize that it receives from the DhtReaderOptions.
Ensure that is true by requiring the size to be at least 1.

Running with 0 recent chunk cache is very a bad idea, often
during commit walking the parents of a commit will be found
on the same chunk as the commit that was just accessed. In
these cases its a good idea to keep that last chunk around
so the parents can be quickly accessed.

A linear search is somewhat acceptable for only 4 recent chunks, but
a HashMap based lookup would be better. The table will have 16 slots
by default and given the hashCode() of ChunkKey is derived from the
SHA-1 of the chunk, each chunk will fall into its own bucket within
the table and thus evaluate only 1 entry during lookup instead of 4.

Some users may also want to devote more memory to the recent chunks,
in which case expanding this list to a longer length will help to
reduce chunk faults, but would increase search time. Using a HashMap
will help this code to scale to larger sizes better.

Instead of fixing the prefetch queue and recent chunk queue as
different sizes, allow these to share the same limit but be scaled
based on the work being performed.

During walks about 20% of the space will be given to the prefetcher,
and the other 80% will be used by the recent chunks cache. This
should improve cases where there is bad locality between chunks.

During writing of a pack stream, 90-100% of the space should be
made available to the prefetcher, as the prefetch plan is usually
very accurate about the order chunks will be needed in.

A set of ref names like ('a/b' and 'a+b') would cause the RefDirectory
to think that the set of refs have changed because it traversed the
'a' directory in the subtree before looking at 'a+b', but it then
compared with the know refs which are sorted with 'a+b' first.

Fix this by traversing the refs tree in another order. Treat a directory
as if they ends with a '/' before deciding on the order to traverse
the refs tree.

ObjectDirectoryInserter was always creating a temporary file,
writing the complete compressed contents of a tree, fsync()'ing
that to stable storage, and only then checking to see if there
was already an object with the same SHA-1 in the repository.

For commits this strategy makes some sense, the commit is very
unlikely to exist in the repository, as there are embedded times
and these change with each commit.

However for trees coming out of DirCache, it is more common for the
tree to already exist in the repository. Most subdirectories are
not modified in any given commit.  Doing all of this local file IO
for things that already exist is very slow.

Try to detect cases where the object is ""small enough"" that it can
be processed entirely in memory, and avoid doing disk IO entirely
if the object already exists.

Also increase the size of the output buffer for the deflation.
This should boost the average write(2) syscall size from 512 bytes
to 8192 bytes, making streaming of large compressed contents to
disk slightly more efficient.

The cached object databases should not require a close to release

own reference for newCachedDatabase(), so a close() here kills
the real database's internal caches, and possibly underlying files,
resulting in poor performance for the callers of PackParser like
ReceivePack or FetchProcess trying to then go look up objects that
were just parsed, or that current references point to.

In practice the DHT storage layer has not been performing as well as
large scale server environments want to see from a Git server.

The performance of the DHT schema degrades rapidly as small changes
are pushed into the repository due to the chunk size being less than
1/3 of the pushed pack size.  Small chunks cause poor prefetch
performance during reading, and require significantly longer prefetch
lists inside of the chunk meta field to work around the small size.

The DHT code is very complex (>17,000 lines of code) and is very
sensitive to the underlying database round-trip time, as well as the
way objects were written into the pack stream that was chunked and
stored on the database.  A poor pack layout (from any version of C Git
prior to Junio reworking it) can cause the DHT code to be unable to
enumerate the objects of the linux-2.6 repository in a completable
time scale.

Performing a clone from a DHT stored repository of 2 million objects
takes 2 million row lookups in the DHT to locate the OBJECT_INDEX row
for each object being cloned. This is very difficult for some DHTs to
scale, even at 5000 rows/second the lookup stage alone takes 6 minutes
(on local filesystem, this is almost too fast to bother measuring).
Some servers like Apache Cassandra just fall over and cannot complete
the 2 million lookups in rapid fire.

On a ~400 MiB repository, the DHT schema has an extra 25 MiB of
redundant data that gets downloaded to the JGit process, and that is
before you consider the cost of the OBJECT_INDEX table also being
fully loaded, which is at least 223 MiB of data for the linux kernel
repository.  In the DHT schema answering a `git clone` of the ~400 MiB
linux kernel needs to load 248 MiB of ""index"" data from the DHT, in
addition to the ~400 MiB of pack data that gets sent to the client.
This is 193 MiB more data to be accessed than the native filesystem
format, but it needs to come over a much smaller pipe (local Ethernet
typically) than the local SATA disk drive.

I also never got around to writing the ""repack"" support for the DHT
schema, as it turns out to be fairly complex to safely repack data in
the repository while also trying to minimize the amount of changes
made to the database, due to very common limitations on database
mutation rates..

This new DFS storage layer fixes a lot of those issues by taking the
simple approach for storing relatively standard Git pack and index
files on an abstract filesystem. Packs are accessed by an in-process
buffer cache, similar to the WindowCache used by the local filesystem
storage layer. Unlike the local file IO, there are some assumptions
that the storage system has relatively high latency and no concept of
""file handles"". Instead it looks at the file more like HTTP byte range
requests, where a read channel is a simply a thunk to trigger a read
request over the network.

The DFS code in this change is still abstract, it does not store on
any particular filesystem, but is fairly well suited to the Amazon S3
or Apache Hadoop HDFS. Storing packs directly on HDFS rather than
HBase removes a layer of abstraction, as most HBase row reads turn
into an HDFS read.

Most of the DFS code in this change was blatently copied from the
local filesystem code. Most parts should be refactored to be shared
between the two storage systems, but right now I am hesistent to do
this due to how well tuned the local filesystem code currently is.

Instead of updating in batches at the top level, update once per delta

the frequent updates to an update rate that is more reasonable to send
to the UI, while also ensuring a successful pack parse always reaches
100% deltas resolved.

If delta compression is enabled, there are two phases that may run
very quickly. Set the timer to 500 milliseconds instead, reducing the
risk that the user has to wait longer than 1 second before any sort of

the cost unless a thin pack is being constructed.

The ""Counting objects"" phase of packing is the most time consuming
part for any server providing access to Git repositories. Scanning
through the entire project history, including every revision of
every tree that has ever existed is expensive and takes an incredible
amount of CPU time.

Inline the tree parsing logic, unroll a number of loops, and setup
to better handle the common case of seeing another occurrence of
an object that was already marked SEEN.

This change boosts the ""Counting objects"" phase when JGit is acting
as a server and is packing the linux-2.6 repository for its client.
Compared to CGit on the same hardware, a JGit daemon server is now
21883 objects/sec faster:

CGit:
  Counted 2058062 objects in 38981 ms at 52796.54 objects/sec
  Counted 2058062 objects in 38920 ms at 52879.29 objects/sec
  Counted 2058062 objects in 39059 ms at 52691.11 objects/sec

JGit (before):
  Counted 2058062 objects in 31529 ms at 65275.21 objects/sec
  Counted 2058062 objects in 30359 ms at 67790.84 objects/sec
  Counted 2058062 objects in 30033 ms at 68526.69 objects/sec

JGit (this commit):
  Counted 2058062 objects in 28726 ms at 71644.57 objects/sec
  Counted 2058062 objects in 27652 ms at 74427.24 objects/sec
  Counted 2058062 objects in 27528 ms at 74762.50 objects/sec

Above the first run was a ""cold server"". For JGit the JVM had just
started up with `jgit daemon`, and for CGit we hadn't touched the
repository ""recently"" (but it was certainly in kernel buffer cache).
The second and third runs were against the running JGit JVM, allowing
timing tests to better reflect the benefits of JGit's pack and index
caching, as well as any optimizations the JIT may have performed.

The timings are fair.  CGit is opening, checking and mmap'ing both
the pack and index during the timer.  JGit is opening, checking
and malloc+read'ing the pack and index data into its Java heap
during the timer. Both processes are walking the same graph space,
and are computing the ""path hash"" necessary to sort objects in the
object table for delta compression.  Since this commit only impacts
the ""Counting objects"" phase, delta compression was obviously not
included in the timings and JGit may still be performing delta
compression slower than CGit, resulting in an overall slower server
experience for clients.

This reverts commit 67b064fc9fa7418fab83957b4f4e4baf9c6e08be.

The ""tiny optimization"" introduced by 67b0 turns out to have a big
savings on wall-clock time when the object store is very slow (e.g.
the DHT support in JGit), but comes with a much bigger penalty in
space used by the output stream.  CGit packed with 67b0 enabled is
7 MiB larger than it should be (36 MiB rather than 28/29 MiB).  The
much bigger Linux kernel repository gained over 200 MiB, though some
of this may have been caused by a smaller window setting.

Revert this patch as PackWriter should be optimizing for space used
rather than time spent, since its primary use is network transfer, and
that isn't free.

JGit currently identifies loose objects as 'corrupt' if they've been
deflated using a window size less than 32Kb, because the
isStandardFormat() function doesn't recognise the header
byte as a zlib header. This patch makes the method tolerant of
all valid window sizes (15-bit to 8-bit) - but doesn't sacrifice
it's accuracy in distingushing the standard loose-object format
from the experimental (now abandoned) format. It's based on a patch
which has been merged into C-Git master branch:

https://github.com/git/git/commit/7f684a2aff636f44a506

On memory constrained systems zlib may use a much smaller window
size - working on Agit, I found that Android uses a 4KB window;
giving a header byte of 0x48, not 0x78. Consequently all loose
objects generated by the Android platform appear 'corrupt' :(

It might appear that this patch changes isStandardFormat() to the
point where it could incorrectly identify the experimental format as
the standard one, but the two criteria (bitmask & checksum) can only
give a false result for an experimental object where both of the
following are true:

1) object size is exactly 8 bytes when uncompressed (bitmask)
2) [single-byte in-pack git type&size header] * 256
   + [1st byte of the following zlib header] % 31 = 0 (checksum)

As it happens, for all possible combinations of valid object type
(1-4) and window bits (0-7), the only time when the checksum will be
divisible by 31 is for 0x1838 - ie object type *1*, a Commit - which,
due the fields all Commit objects must contain, could never be as
small as 8 bytes in size.

Given this, the combination of the two criteria (bitmask & checksum)
always correctly determines the buffer format, and is more tolerant
than the previous version.

Clients cache the set of advertised references at the start of a
negotiation, and keep replaying the same ""want SHA1"" list to the
server on each negotiation step.  If another client pushes into
a branch and moves it by fast-forward, any request to obtain that
branch's prior SHA-1 is still valid, the commit is reachable from
the new position of the reference.  Unfortunately the fast-forward
causes smart HTTP negotations to fail, as the server no longer is
advertising that prior SHA-1.

Instead of causing clients to fail out with a ""want invalid"" error
and forcing the end-user retry, possibly getting into a never ending
try-fail-retry race while other clients are pushing into the same
busy repository, allow the slightly stale want request so long as
it is still reachable.

C Git implemented this same change recently to fix races on the
smart HTTP protocol when the C Git git-http-backend is used.

The new RequestPolicy feature also allows server authors to make
an even more lenient configuration that exports any SHA-1 to the
client. This might be useful in certain settings where a server
has authenticated the client as the ""repository owner"" and wants
to allow them to grab any content from the server as a complete
unbroken history chain.

The new setAdvertisedRefs() method allows server authors to manually
fix the references that are advertised, possibly bypassing the
getAllRefs() call on the Repository object.

Add a TransportConfigCallback parameter to JGit API commands to allow
transport-type-specific configuration to be set on the Transport
after it's been created.

My specific use-case is configuring additional properties on
SshTransport - I need to take over the SshSessionFactory used by the
transport. Using the TransportConfigCallback parameter I can simply
do this (rather than reimplement the commands):

public void configure(Transport tn) {
  if (tn instanceof SshTransport) {
    ((SshTransport) tn).setSshSessionFactory(factoryProvider.get());
  }
}

The Transport type is only known once the remote has been resolved
and the URI parsed, which is why it makes sense to have this as a
callback- passing the generated Transport object back to the user
allows them to easily configure it without restriction.

Alternatives to this approach:

- Specifically add a SshSessionFactory parameter to JGit API
commands, which would add nasty transport-specific code to the API
and set a bad precedent for ballooning the API with other transport-
specific parameters.

- Allow users to pre-create the Transport and set it on the command.
Not good: the user has to resolve the remote for themselves.

- A non-static Transport-factory approach, letting user supply the
command a TransportFactory. A larger change (removing all the static
'open()' methods from Transport) and more than I need for this use
case at least - I'm happy enough with the transport resolution, I
just want to configure the transport once it's generated.

-so the callback is the best option in my view.

A note about where this leaves the API - there are now 4 commands:

CloneCommand
PullCommand
FetchCommand
PushCommand

-that share 3 identical transport-related parameters:

timeout
credentialsProvider
transportConfigurator

I think there's potential for introducing an interface or val-object
to identify/encapsulate this repetition, which I'd be happy to do in
a subsequent commit.

The purpose of this commit is to prevent destruction of
submodules on checkout from a tree with a submodule to
another. For consistency we handle the reverse case too,
when we checkout a branch that has a submodule and the
submodule directory exists. And finally we ignore the
case where the submodule changes.

We do not update the submodules, we just try to ignore
them harder.

Since we replaced GitIndex by DirCache JGit didn't fire
IndexChangedEvents anymore. For EGit this still worked with a high
latency since its RepositoryChangeScanner which is scheduled to
run each 10 seconds fires the event in case the index changes.
This scanner is meant to detect index changes induced by a different
process e.g. by calling ""git add"" from native git.

When the index is changed from within the same process we should fire
the event synchronously.

The checkout command was producing a inconsistent state of the index
which even confuses native git. The content sha1 of the touched index
entries was updated, but the length and the filemode was not updated.
Later in coding the index entries got automatically corrected (throught
Dircache.checkoutEntry()) but the correction was after persisting the
index to disk. So, the correction was lost and we ended up with a index
where length and sha1 doesn't fit together.
A similar problem is fixed with ""lastModified"" of DircacheEntry. When
checking out a path without specifying an explicit commit (you want to
checkout what's in the index) the index was not updated regarding
lastModified. Readers of the index will think the checked-out
file is dirty because the file has a younger lastmodified then what's
in the index.

The client's use of UnionInputStream was broken when combined with a
8192 byte buffer used by PackParser. A smart HTTP client connection
always pushes in the execute stateless RPC input stream after the
data stream has ended from the remote peer. At the end of the pack,
PackParser asked to fill a 8192 byte buffer, but if only e.g. 1000
bytes remained UnionInputStream went to the next stream and asked
it for input, which triggered a new RPC, and failed because there
was nothing pending in the request buffer.

Change UnionInputStream to only return what it consumed from a
single InputStream without invoking the next InputStream, just in
case that second InputStream happens to be one of these magical
ones that generates an RPC invocation.

All Git URLs operate off a suffix approach, for example the default
binding is for paths such as:

  */info/refs
  */git-upload-pack
  */git-receive-pack

These names are not common on project hosting servers, especially
one like Gerrit Code Review.

In addition to offering Git-over-HTTP as a servlet, offer it as a
filter that triggers when a matching suffix appears, but otherwise
delegates the request through the chain.  This filter would permit
Gerrit Code Review to place projects at the root of the server,
rather than within the ""/p/"" subdirectory, making the HTTP and SSH
URL structure exactly match each other.

To prevent breakage with existing users, the MetaServlet and
GitServlet are kept as wrappers delegating to their filters,
returning 404 Not Found when the filter has no match.

Decorators need to know whether folders in the working tree contain only

folders. This works only together with treewalks which operate in

postorder mode (files are walked before their parent folder is walked) 
this detection doesn't work.

the DeltaWindows, we just overestimate based on the config parameters
(though we may underestimate if the maximum size is not set).

For the ObjectToPack instances, we do some rough byte accounting of the
underlying Java object representation.

The DfsReader must offer every representation of an object that
exists on the local repository when PackWriter asks for them. This
is necessary to identify objects in the thin pack part that are also
in the cached pack that will be appended onto the end of the stream.

Without looking at all alternatives, PackWriter may pack the same
object twice (once in the thin section, again in the cached base
pack). This may cause the command line C version to go into an
infinite loop when repacking the resulting repository, as it may see
a delta chain cycle with one of those duplicate copies of the object.

Previously the DfsReader tried to avoid looking at packs that it
might not care about, but this is insufficient, as all versions
must be considered during pack generation.

Consider two objects A->B where A uses B as a delta base, and these
are in the same source pack file ordered as ""A B"".

If cached packs is enabled and B is also in the cached pack that
will be appeneded onto the end of the thin pack, and both A, B are
supposed to be in the thin pack, PackWriter must consider the fact
that A's base B is an edge object that claims to be part of the
new pack, but is actually ""external"" and cannot be written first.

If the object reuse system considered B candidates fist this bug
does not arise, as B will be marked as edge due to it existing in
the cached pack. When the A candidates are later examined, A sees a
valid delta base is available as an edge, and will not later try to
""write base first"" during the writing phase.

However, when the reuse system considers A candidates first they
see that B will be in the outgoing pack, as it is still part of
the thin pack, and arrange for A to be written first. Later when A
switches from being in-pack to being an edge object (as it is part
of the cached pack) the pointer in B does not get its type changed
from ObjectToPack to ObjectId, so B thinks A is non-edge.

We work around this case by also checking that the delta base B
is non-edge before writing the object to the pack. Later when A
writes its object header, delta base B's ObjectToPack will have
an offset == 0, which makes isWritten() = false, and the OBJ_REF
delta format will be used for A's header. This will be resolved by
the client to the copy of B that appears in the later cached pack.

ReceivePack (and PackParser) can be configured with the
maxObjectSizeLimit in order to prevent users from pushing too large
objects to Git. The limit check is applied too all object types
although it is most likely that a BLOB will exceed the limit.  In all
cases the size of the object header is excluded from the object size
which is checked against the limit as this is the size of which a BLOB
object would take in the working tree when checked out as a file.

Delta objects (both offset and ref delta) are also checked against the
limit.

When an object exceeds the maxObjectSizeLimit the receive-pack will
fail immediately. Therefore, we can only report the SHA1 of this (too
large) object back to the user. In order to help the user locate the
path to this object in his local repository we provide a Git command
for that in the error message.

The GitSmartHttpTools class started as utility functions to help report
useful error messages to users of the android.googlesource.com service.

Now that the GitServlet and GitFilter classes support filters before a
git-upload-pack or git-receive-pack request, server implementors may
these routines helpful to report custom messages to clients.  Using the
sendError() method to return an HTTP 200 OK with error text embedded in
the payload prevents native Git clients from retrying the action with a
dumb Git or WebDAV HTTP request.

Refactor some of the existing code to use these new error functions and
protocol constants.  The new sendError() function is very close to being
identical to the old error handling code in RepositoryFilter, however we
now use the POST Content-Type rather than the Accept HTTP header to check
if the client will accept the error data in the response body rather than
using the HTTP status code.  This is a more reliable way of checking for
native Git clients, as the Accept header was not always populated with the
correct string in older versions of Git smart HTTP.

Error messages are typically short, below the 32 KiB in-memory buffer
size of the SmartOutputStream. When an error is queued up for sending
to a client and an exception is thrown up into the servlet handler we
discarded the message and sent nothing to the client, as the messages
were stuck inside of the SmartOutputStream buffer.

Hoist the creation of the output stream above the invocation of try
block of the service, and use close() in the few catch blocks that
assume there are buffered messages ready for transmission. This will
ensure errors from unpacking a stream in ReceivePack are sent off to
a client correctly, as previously these were causing no status report
to arrive at the client side as the data was stuck in the buffer.

The HTTP RFCs require a server to fully consume the request body before
it can return a non-error status code, which is any code below 400.

JGit returns most Git level errors inside of an HTTP 200 OK response,
and sometimes this happens before the entire request was consumed from
the servlet container. In such cases the body must be skipped or read
until EOF is reached, ensuring the HTTP keep-alive semantics will work
for the next request on the same TCP connection.

HTTP status codes >= 400 may be returned without consuming the body,
and a servlet container must set ""Connection: close"" in the response
headers when this happens, since the state of the request body is not
well defined with an early abort.

With the introduction of sendError() in GitSmartHttpTools there are
only a handful of locations that need to worry about the request body
being consumed, so sprinkle the call in as necessary.

When ResolveMerger finds a path where he has to do a content merge he
will try the content merge and if that succeeds he'll add the newly
produced content to the index. For the FileMode of this new index entry 
he blindly copies the FileMode he finds for that path in the common base
tree. If by chance the common base tree does not contain this path he'll
try to add FileMode 0 (MISSING) to the index.

One could argue that this can't happen: how can the ResolveMerger
successfully (with not conflicts) merge two contents if there is no
common base? This was due to another bug in ResolveMerger. He failed to
find out that for two files which differ only in the FileMode (e.g. 644
vs. 755) he should not try a content merge.

Currently files in a repository marked as executable will have
that mode unset when modified and committed on systems that
do not support detection of this mode since the working tree
iterator will never report this mode for any entries.

This change updates AddCommand to check if the index file
mode should be used instead of the working tree file mode
when adding files to the index.

There are still other areas that need updating, but I wanted
to first get feedback on one potential approach for fixing this
issue.

If after resolving all conflicts nothing is left to commit, behave like
cgit, and display a nice message informing the user.

Currently, EGit displays a ""HEAD advanced fast forward"" message, which
is absolutely not helpful at all.

This is the basic API revamping required to get that state communicated
to the outside world (EGit). Another possibility would be to ""abuse""
some other state (I didn't see a cleaner way to do it).

I know this breaks public APIs, but still this is the best way i saw.

Handle more cases for file mode changes. Especially make sure that the
following cases are handled correctly.

Case 1)

  An entry in the working tree, HEAD tree, and merge tree have
  different modes and different content.

  Prior Outcome:
    Dirty working tree content is replaced and file mode
    changes are lost.

  New Outcome:
    Conflict is generated.

Case 2)

  An entry in the index and merge tree have the same content
  but different modes but both modes are file type modes.

  Prior Outcome:
    File mode in working tree is not updated and the working
    directory is dirty.

  New Outcome:
    Index is updated and the working directory is clean.

There are a few situations where you want to delete files or folders but
where you are not interested in getting exceptions if this doesn't
succeed. E.g. if you delete garbage in the GC class you want that if
certain files can't be deleted the command succeeds. Maybe the next
garbage collector run has more luck not to interfere with a virus
scanner run on Windows. Therefore an option is added to
FileUtils.delete() not to report errors in such cases.

Previously a DirCacheCheckout was done using a merge tree reflected
the state of the repository when the stash was originally done.
This was wrong since unstashing after making subsequent commits
would revert changes already committed.

The new approach is to scan for conflicts initially using a 6-way
tree walk that contains the trees for the stashed HEAD, stashed
index, stashed working directory, current HEAD, current index, and
current working directory.  Then perform a subsequent scan of the
stashed HEAD, index, and working directory trees and apply all
the stashed differences to the current index and working directory.

clone, fetch and push can all update multiple references in a single
command invocation. Rather than performing sequential iteration
of each reference change inside of the application code, push this
down into the reference database where the implementation can take
advantage of the batch size and optimize itself.

For the local filesystem implementation the obvious optimization
is to write a packed-refs file when the repository is completely
empty. The initial clone, fetch or push into the destination may
have hundreds of new references. Writing all of these as loose
files is not efficient.

To make the API changes simple, define the BatchRefUpdate type and
implementation using the existing sequential behavior.

before a {Upload,Receive}Pack handler is assigned and certainly before
it has read the request. So we must read the first line manually within
sendError() to tell whether sideband is needed.

The fetch-pack/upload-pack stream usually has an LF at the

Perform the same trim for send-pack/receive-pack, as it is

When fetching over smart HTTP the InputStream that gets fed into
a PackParser doesn't really support EOF at the end of the pack. It
instead tries to make a new HTTP request, which fails because there
is no request body currently buffered by the client.

Make EOF work correctly on the end of an HTTP derived InputStream
for the pack by denoting no more requests are expected as the higher
level code is now consuming the pack (or side-band embedded pack).
Smart HTTP support doesn't automatically enqueue execute support onto
the end of the UnionInputStream, which allows the UnionInputStream
to correctly reflect EOF when the HTTP response is consumed.

Auto CRLF isn't special enough to be screwing around with the buffers
used for raw byte processing of the ObjectInserter API. If it needs a
buffer to process a file that is bigger than the buffer allocated by
an ObjectInserter, it needs to do its own buffer management.

Recently Robin tried to increase the size of the buffer used by
ObjectInserter to fix a bug in the InputStream that handles AutoCRLF.
The purpose of this buffer is NOT to make a random InputStream work
correctly by passing it a larger buffer during read(byte[],int,int).

Clarify the Javadoc on the buffer() method to reduce the risk
someone tries to abuse it again.

While we are here, modify the method to load the field into a local
variable before returning. This should cut down 1 field load during
the common case of the buffer being already allocated.

Decrease running time for getStringList (and all other get methods) by
looking for configuration entries using binary search rather than
linear search through the configuration file.

Configuration lines are sorted by section, subsection, name in a
sorted list whenever the snapshot is rebuilt. Binary search is used to
locate an index in the middle of the values, then walk backwards to
find the first value in the range.

Given a configuration of file of 5000 distinct section/subsection/name
triplets (e.g. a Gerrit Code Review project.config configuration file
with 5000 unique access control rules), this new code is faster to
lookup each rule individually using getStringList():

  old setStringList() 194 usec avg
      getStringList() 196 usec avg

  new setStringList() 188 usec avg
      getStringList()  24 usec avg

Parsing the size from a packed object header was incorrectly computing
the total inflated length when the length exceeded the range of a Java
int. The next 7 bits of size information was shifted left as an int
using a shift of 25 bits, placing the higher bits of the size into the
sign position. When this size was extended to a long to be added to
the current size accumulator the size went negative, resulting in
NegativeArraySizeException being thrown.

Fix all places where this particular pattern of code is used to read a
pack size field, or a binary delta header, as they both use the same
variable length encoding scheme.

There are other users though, which I believe should never be used

non-dangerous.

As an alternative we could create a new method to do the copy

PackWriter supports excluding objects from being written to the pack.
You may specify a PackIndex which lists all those objects which should
not go into the new pack. This feature was broken because not all
commits have been checked whether they should be excluded or not. For
other object types the exclude algorithm worked. This commit adds the
missing check.

All commands should throw a GitAPIException so new exceptions can be

a Git API should catch GitAPIException and not just the currently known
exceptions.

Now the only checked exceptions on Git API calls are GitException and
subclasses of it. New checked exceptions that are subclasses of
GitException may be added without breaking the API.

Unfortunately this change itself breaks the API.

Previously if a packed-refs file was racily clean then there
was a 2.5 second window in which each call to getPackedRefs
would increment the mod count causing a RefsChangedEvent to be
fired since the FileSnapshot would report the file as modified.

If a RefsChangedListener called getRef/getRefs from the

since the stack could be exhausted before the 2.5 second
window expired and the packed-refs file would no longer
report being modified.

Now a SHA-1 is computed of the packed-refs file and the
mod count is only incremented when the packed refs are
successfully set and the id of the new packed-refs file
does not match the id of the old packed-refs file.

Include some behaviors that were not clear to me until I had used it a
few times.

Warn about broken behavior for capture groups that do not match. It
would be nice to support these, but even for the cases where it's
clear what the behavior should be, it would be infeasible to
implement.

For example, consider the second group of the regex ""(/a)/b(/c)?""
matched against the path ""/a/b"". We might want getServletPath() to
return ""/a/b"" and getPathInfo() to return null, but this is hard to
implement: there's no easy way to say ""the substring up to the point
where (/c) would have matched if it were in the string even though
it's not."" And even if we could, it's not clear there is even a right
answer in the general case.

Moreover, ideally we could warn about such broken patterns at servlet
initialization time, rather than at runtime, but even answering the
question of whether there are capture groups that might not match
requires more customized regular expression parsing than we want to
embark on. Hence, the best we can do is document how it fails.

ResolveMerger#mergeImpl() was only returning false (= failed) when there
were unmerged paths. In the case when there were only failing paths, it
returned true.

Because MergeCommand looks at the return value for determining if the
merge failed, it would fall into the successful case there, where it
should instead return a MergeResult with MergeStatus.FAILED.

This change adds a test case for this and makes the ResolveMerger return
false when there are failing paths.

This was discovered while working on fixing bug 354099 and is needed for
its test case.

Before, the paths to delete were stored in a HashMap, which doesn't have
a particular order. So when e.g. both the file ""a/b"" and the directory
""a"" were to be deleted, it would sometimes try to delete ""a"" first. This
resulted in a failed path because File#delete() fails when a directory
isn't empty.

With this change, an ArrayList is used for storing the paths to delete.
The list contains the paths in a top-down order, as defined by the order
of processEntry. When the files are deleted, the list is iterated in
reverse, ensuring that all files of a directory are deleted before the
directory itself.

Whenever a call to JGit returns a Repository the caller should make sure
to call close() on it if he doesn't need it anymore. Since instances of
Repository contain e.g. open FileOutputStreams (for pack
files) forgetting to close the repository can lead to resource leaks.
This was the reason why dozens of the JUnit tests on windows to failed
with ""Can't delete file ...."" errors. In
LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase.tearDown() we tried to delete the repo's we
used during tests which failed because we had open FileOutputStreams.

Not only the obvious cases during Clone or Init operations returned
Repositories, but also the new SubModule API created repository
instances. In some places we even forgot to close submodule repositories
in our internal coding.

To see the effects of this fix run the JGit JUnit tests under Windows.
On other platforms it's harder to see because either the leaking
resources don't lead to failing junit tests (on Unix you can delete
files with open FileOutputStreams) or the java gc run's differently
cleans up the resources earlier.

it uses chunked encoding with an error message.

Prior to some more recent versions, git push over HTTP failed to
report status information and error messages due to a race within
the client and its helper process. Check for these bad versions and
send errors as messages before the status report, enabling users
to see the failures on their terminal.

It was easy to create multiple packs with exactly the same name and
same DfsRepositoryDescription in a test, which can poison the
DfsBlockCache. The javadoc for DfsObjDatabase.newPack() explicitly
says pack names should be unique within an entire DFS, so do this by
making the packId AtomicInteger static.

Arguably, test writers shouldn't be doing things like putting
'new DfsRepositoryDescription(""test"")' in a setUp() method, but that's
a natural thing to do, and we don't document this restriction
anywhere.

When updating smudged entries use a pathfilter to iterate only over
working tree files which have an associated smudged index entry.

Commit dac66672df0535f61a13273524d46e1e0012ca69 introduced that we
check and update smudged entries while persisting a dircache. Before
that commit adding a file to git caused  file i/o for the index file,
the object database (to store new content) and all files we wanted to
add (to read new content). After that commit we have additionally file
i/o for every file in the working tree (even ignored files).
Especially on windows iterating over the working tree can be very
time consuming. This decreased the performance of persisting a dircache
dramatically (I measured factors 4 to 10 while adding a file to linux
kernel repo). One could easily see this effect when dragging&dropping
modified files in a linux kernel repo in the egit staging view.

JGit allows to create commits which have duplicate parents: e.g. a
commit X has first parent Y and second parent Y. Such commits are not
handled correctly by PlotCommit leading to wrong display of the history
in EGit. In such cases there is a never ending passing line drawn beside
all commits younger than the commit with duplicate parents. This commit
fixes this by explicitly checking for duplicate parents.

In a different commit we should fix JGit not to create commits with
duplicate parents. I think native git also doesn't allow such commits,
 although history display in native git (gitk, git log --graph) is not
damaged by such commits.

This adds a new optional argument to DiffEntry.scan, which is used to
decide whether a DiffEntry should be ""marked"". After having called scan,
the user can then call isMarked() on the entries to find out whether
they matched the passed TreeFilter.

An example use case for this is in the file diff viewer of EGit's
History view, where we'd like to highlight entries that are matching the
current filter. E.g. when the History view is filtered to a single file,
only commits that affect this file are shown. But when selecting a
commit, the file diff viewer shows all changed files in that commit.
When there are many changed files, it can be hard to find the
interesting file. With this change, we can highlight the filtered file
(or tone down the others).

Currently, after a merge/cherry-pick/rebase, all index entries are
smudged as the ResolveMerger never sets entry lengths and/or
modification times. This change teaches it to re-set them at least for
things it did not touch. The other entries are then repaired when the
index is persisted, or entries are checked out.

The first attempt to get this in was commit
3ea694c2523d909190b5350e13254a62e94ec5d5 which has been reverted.
Since then some fixes to ResolveMerger and a few more tests have
been added which check situations where the index is not matching
HEAD before we merge.

On conflicts in rebase or cherry-pick, the conflict markers were like
this:

    <<<<<<< OURS

    b
    >>>>>>> THEIRS

This is technically correct, but it could be better.

It's especially confusing during a rebase, where the meaning of
OURS/THEIRS is not obvious. The intuition is that ""ours"" is the commits
that ""I"" did before the rebase, but it's the other way around because of
the way rebase works. See various bug reports and stackoverflow
discussions.

With this change, in the case of a cherry-pick while on master, the
markers will be like this:

    <<<<<<< master
    a
    =======

It's not ""master"" because that would only be correct for the first
cherry-pick during a rebase, after that, it's master + already
cherry-picked commits.

And in the case of a ""git pull --rebase"":

    <<<<<<< Upstream, based on branch 'master' of git@example.org:repo

When a file is marked as removed in the index and neither contents nor
mode differ between ""head"" and ""merge"", the index should be kept. If
they differ, a checkout conflict should occur. This is described in
Git's git-read-tree.txt.

JGit used to replace the index state with ""merge"" in both of the above
cases.

A confusing effect of this was that when one removed a file and then did
a rebase, the file silently reappeared again.

The changes to dir/file conflict handling are a consequence of this
change, as the index handling change made tests in DirCacheCheckoutTest
break. I compared these cases to C Git and the new behavior there also
matches what C Git does.

JGit was not able to lookup refs which had the name of files which exist
in the .git folder. When JGit was looking up a ref named X it has a
fixed set of directories where it searched for files named X
(ignore packed refs for now). First directory to search for is .git. In
case of the ref named 'config' it searched there for this file, found it
(it's the .git/config file with the repo configuration in it), parsed
it, found it is an invalid ref and stopped searching. It never looked
for a file .git/refs/heads/config.

I changed JGit in a way that when it finds a file which corresponds to a
ref name and if this file doesn't contain a valid ref then it will
continue searching in the remaining folders for the right file. If no
further valid file is found then the originally IOException is thrown.

performance and has been in production at Google for many months
now, proving it is a viable storage backend for Git.

As there are no users of the storage.dht schema, either at Google or
any other company, nor any valid open source implementations of the
storage system, drop the entire package and API from the JGit project.

This flag was added to provide an unsafe operation on the local
repository because the storage.dht code was too damn slow to provide
proper safe Git behavior all of the time. Now that stoarge.dht has
been removed from the repository, also delete this unsafe flag to
prevent applications from misusing the JGit library and permitting
users to potentially damage their local repository with bad data
received from an untrusted peer.

None of these should have been exposed to base classes. The majority
of them are private implementation details that are not required by a
subclass in order to interact with the base protocol definition. The
few that are needed should be visible as accessor methods, so the
internals can be modified without breaking the public JGit API.

In order to parse user specified strings containing date and time info
a thread-safe parser is implemented. This is needed for example to
interpret configuration parameters (e.g. gc.pruneexpire where need to
parse strings like ""2 weeks ago""). The parser is thread-safe by caching
SimpleDateFormat instances in a ThreadLocal cache.

Native git has a parser called approxidate which is able to interpret a
huge number of formats (""1 year ago"", ""tea time"", ...). Ideally JGit
should be able to parse the same strings as native git but for now this
parser understands the following subset:

""now""
""yesterday""
""(x) years|months|weeks|days|hours|minutes|seconds ago""
""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z"" (ISO)
""EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z"" (RFC)
""yyyy-MM-dd""

""MM/dd/yyyy""
""dd.MM.yyyy""
""EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss yyyy Z"" (DEFAULT)

The underlying problem is that System.out is a PrintWriter and
as such it does not throw exceptions on error, but rather just
sets a flag and continues.

This changes replaces the use of System.out with a PrintWriter-like
writer that does not catch error, but instead throw them to the
caller.

Disable streaming compression on large git-upload-pack responses,
as these are usually highly compressed Git pack data. Trying to
compress these with gzip will only waste CPU time and additional
transfer space with the gzip wrapper. Small git-upload-pack data
is usually text based negotiation responses and can be squeezed
smaller with a little bit of CPU usage.

The stock C Git client will report HTTP 406 error if it predates
1.6.6 or something goes wrong with the smart request and it tried
falling back to the dumb request. This may help to debug cases where
a broken proxy server exists between the client and the server and

Some GC tests were sporadically failing. The reason was that they used
the setExpireAgeMillis method to define object expiration before
invoking the prune method. Depending on the CPU load during the test
run, the prune method may reach an object (which is considered
non-expired by the test) too late and actually prune it.

To make the test stable we now use the setExpire(Date expire) method and
define a time instant before which objects are considered to be expired.
This way the outcome of the prune method doesn't depend on the CPU load.

magically replacing 2.0.12 with 2.0.16. Which doesn't work from
Maven 2, and didn't work at least some of the time in Maven 3 on
my workstation. Its unclear how Hudson CI was able to verify this
commit when Robin rebased it prior to submit.

Update the ObjectReuseAsIs API to support creating new
ObjectToPack with only the AnyObjectId and Git object type. This is
needed to support the future pack index bitmaps, which only contain
this information and do not want the overhead of creating a temporary
object for every ObjectId.

Pack index version E003 extends version 2 by including compressed
bitmaps of the object graph. Furthermore, a logical API of the index
functionality is included, as it is expected to be used by the
PackWriter.

Compressed bitmaps are created using the javaewah library, which is a
word-aligned compressed variant of the Java bitset class based on
run-length encoding. The library only works with positive integer
values. Thus, the maximum number of ObjectIds in a pack file that
this index can currently support is limited to Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Every ObjectId is given an integer mapping. The integer is the
position of the ObjectId in the complete ObjectId list, sorted
by offset, for the pack file. That integer is what the bitmaps
use to reference the ObjectId. Currently, the new index format can
only be used with pack files that contain a complete closure of the
object graph e.g. the result of a garbage collection.

The index file includes four bitmaps for the Git object types i.e.
commits, trees, blobs, and tags. In addition, a collection of
bitmaps keyed by an ObjectId is also included. The bitmap for each entry
in the collection represents the full closure of ObjectIds reachable
from the keyed ObjectId (including the keyed ObjectId itself). The
bitmaps are further compressed by XORing the current bitmaps against
prior bitmaps in the index, and selecting the smallest representation.
The XOR'd bitmap and offset from the current entry to the position
of the bitmap to XOR against is the actual representation of the entry
in the index file.

Update the PackWriter to support writing out E003 indexes.
Bitmaps are selected at commits every 100 to 10,000 commits for
each unique path from the start. The most recent 20,000 commits
have a bitmap every 100 commits. From there, the distance linearly
increasing with the total number of commits in the graph. Commits
with more than 1 parent are prefered over ones with 1 or less.

Bitmaps are used to speed up the counting phase when packing, for
requests that are not shallow. The PackWriterBitmapWalker uses
a RevFilter to proactively mark commits with RevFlag.SEEN, when
they appear in a bitmap. The walker produces the full closure
of reachable ObjectIds, given the collection of starting ObjectIds.

For fetch request, two ObjectWalks are executed to compute the
ObjectIds reachable from the haves and from the wants. The
ObjectIds needed to be written are determined by taking all the
resulting wants AND NOT the haves.

For clone requests, we get cached pack support for ""free"" since
it is possible to determine if all of the ObjectIds in a pack file
are included in the resulting list of ObjectIds to write.

On my machine, the best times for clones and fetches of the linux
kernel repository (with about 2.6M objects and 300K commits) are
tabulated below:

With bug 391855, DirCacheEditor's PathEdit will be applied for each

That patch replaced most uses of System.out with a wrapper, with
changes like the following:

	 class Diff extends TextBuiltin {
		private final DiffFormatter diffFmt = new DiffFormatter( //
	-			new BufferedOutputStream(System.out));
	+			new BufferedOutputStream(outs));

outs is not set for TextBuiltin objects until init() has been run.
Moving the initialization to after the super.init() call gets
""jgit diff"" and ""jgit log -p"" working well again.

TreeArchiveStream to support ""download tree as zip/tgz/txz"" links in
web frontends like Gitiles and to give VCS-agnostic code search tools
access to the tracked source code.

This patch is a proof-of-concept to show what is possible and offers
minimal functionality.  It uses java.util.zip which is not aware of
InfoZIP extensions for representing symlinks and file permissions, so
symlinks, executable files, and gitlinks are represented as plain text
files.  Making this functionality available from the library,
improving handling of special entries, and support for other file
formats like (e.g., tar) are left for later patches.

Test with ""jgit my-favorite-tree >out.zip"".

Introduce a new CLIGitCommand.rawExecute() helper that behaves
just like execute() except that instead of processing its output
it returns it raw.

So now you can do

	final byte[] expect = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
	final byte[] actual = CLIGitCommand.rawExecute(
			""git show HEAD:goo.raw"", db);
	assertArrayEquals(expect, actual);

to test the output from ""git show HEAD:goo.raw"" without being
distracted by encoding issues.

Noticed while writing tests for a new ""jgit archive"" command that
writes its output in ZIP format.

ContainerTreeIterator also needs to create entries for File objects in
case of filtered resources. Instead of reimplementing FileEntry there,
make the constructor public so that it can be reused.

Also allow to pass a WorkingTreeIterator instead of a FileTreeIterator
in FileTreeIterator's constructor, which is enough and allows to pass
other subclasses.

The Apache Commons Compress library provides a similar interface to
java.util.zip with some features not found in java.util.zip, including
support for inclusion of metadata (file mode and symlink targets) and
support for multiple file formats (zip, .tar.xz, etc).

Use it, in preparation for making use of these features.  No
functional change intended yet.

A previous version of this patch used plexus-archiver.  That is a
heavier-weight dependency and offers a less convenient interface.

Thanks to James Moger and Chris Aniszczyk for advice.

reset() was broken and probably only worked when the position was
at the beginning. More serious was that back() sometimes descended
into the tree rather than skipping backward at the same level. Sometimes
this would result in false conflicts, but one could suspect silent
errors too. back() is called by the NamingConflictTreeWalk when looking
for directory/file conflics.

Also added toString to DirCacheTree to simplify debugging.

If multiple threads attempted to insert loose objects into the same new
fan-out directory, the creation of that directory was subject to a race
condition that could lead to an unnecessary IOException being thrown -
because an inserter could not 'create' a directory that had just been
generated by a different thread. All we require is that the directory
does indeed *exist*, so not being able to _create_ it is not actually a
fatal problem. Setting 'skipExisting' to 'true' on the call to mkdir()
fixes the issue.

I found this issue as a real world occurrence while working on The BFG
Repo Cleaner (https://github.com/rtyley/bfg-repo-cleaner), a tool which
concurrently performs a lot of object creation.

In order to demonstrate the problem here I've added a small test case
which reliably reproduces the issue on the few different hardware
systems I've tried. The error thrown when the race-condition arises is
this:

java.io.IOException: Creating directory /home/roberto/repo.git/objects/e6 failed

The most important difference is that in Java7 we have symbolic links
and for most operations in the work tree we want to operate on the link
itself rather than the link target, which the old File methods generally
do.

We also add support for the hidden attribute, which only makes sense
on Windows.

A new bundle is only activated when run with a Java7 execution
environment. It is implemented as a fragment.

The change includes comparing symbolic links between disk and index,
adding symbolic links to the index, creating/modifying links on
checkout. The behavior is controlled by the core.symlinks setting, just
as C Git does. When a new repository is created core.symlinks will be
set depending on the capabilities of the operating system and Java
runtime.

If core.symlinks is set to true, the assumption is that
symlinks are supported, which may result in runtime errors if this
turs out not to be the case.

This has the same logic as isNameConflicting, but instead of only
returning a boolean, it returns a collection of names that conflict.

It will be used in EGit to provide a better message to the user when
validating a ref name, see Ibea9984121ae88c488858b8a8e73b593195b15e0.

Existing implementations of isNameConflicting could be rewritten like
this:

  return !getConflictingNames(name).isEmpty();

But I'm not sure about that, as isNameConflicting can be implemented in
a faster way than getConflictingNames.

There is a huge performance issue when using both JGit (EGit) and Git
because JGit does not fille all dircache stat fields with the values Git
would expect. As a result thereof Git would typically revalidate a large
number of tracked files. This can take several minutes for large
repositories with many large files.

Since 1.8.2 Git will restrict stat checking to the size and whole second
part of the modification time stamp, if core.statinfo is set to
""minimal"".

As JGit checks only size and modification time this is close to what
JGit already does. To make the match perfect ignore the sub-second part
of the modification time stamp if core.statinfo = minimal.

When a lot of commits are added to DateRevQueue, the
sort-on-insertion approach is very heavy on CPU cycles.

One approach to fix this was made by Dave Borowitz:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5491/

But using Java's PriorityQueue seems to have brought some
extra overhead, and the desired performance could not be
reached.

This fix takes another approach to the insertion problem,
without changing the expected behaviour or bringing extra
memory overhead:

If we detect over 1000 commits in the DateRevQueue, a
""seek-index"" is rebuilt every 1000th added commit.

The index keeps track of every 100th commit in the
DateRevQueue. During insertions, it will be used for a
preliminary scanning of the queue, with the intention of
helping add() find a good starting point to start walking
from. After finding this starting point, add() will step
commit-by-commit until the correct insertion place in
the queue is found (today, the queue is expected to be
sorted at all times).

When applied to repositories with many refs, this approach
has proven to bring huge performance gains and scales quite
well.

For instance, in a repository with close to 80000 refs,
we could cut down the time a typical Gerrit replication
of 1 commit would take (just a push from JGit's point of
view) from 32sec down to 3.5sec.

Below you see some typical times to add a specific amount
of commits (with random commit times) to the DateRevQueue
and the difference the preliminary seek-index makes:

Commits | Index | No Index
   1024     2ms        4ms
   2048     5ms        4ms
   4096     8ms       15ms
   8192     9ms       69ms
  16384    11ms      451ms
  32768    41ms     3092ms
  65536   130ms    15642ms
 131072   464ms    71960ms

Only one extra LinkedList reference is needed for every 100
inserted commits (and only when we see more than 1000 commits
in the queue), so the memory overhead should be negligible.

It may be worth noting that ties are still broken in FIFO
order.

Various index-stepping values were tested, and 100 seemed to
scale very well and be effective from start.

In the future, it should probably be dynamic and based on
the number of refs in the queue, but this should serve well
as a starting point.

Note: While other fundamentally different data structures may
be more suitable, the DateRevQueue is extremely central to
many of the Git core operations. This approach was chosen,
since the effect of the patch is easy to predict in conjuction
with the current implementation. A totally new data structure
will make it harder to predict behaviour in many common and
uncommon cases (in terms of breaking ties, memory usage, cost
when using few elements, object creation/disposing overhead,
etc).

No longer invoke the expensive RefDatabase.isNameConflicting() check on
updating existing refs, reducing batch ref update time by ~97%.

The RefDirectory implementation of isNameConflicting() is quite
slow (it has to do an expensive loose-ref scan) but it's only necessary
to perform this check on ref update if the ref is being *created* - if
the ref already exists, we can already guarantee that it does not
conflict with any other refs.

C-Git seems to use a similar condition before making the
is_refname_available() check:

https://github.com/git/git/blob/v1.8.1.4/refs.c#L1660-L1670

As an example of the effects on performance, here's a simple timing
experiment using The BFG to remove one file from the JGit repo:

---
$ wget http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg-repo-cleaner/1.0.1/bfg-1.0.1.jar
$ git clone --mirror https://git.eclipse.org/r/p/jgit/jgit.git
$ java -jar bfg-1.0.1.jar -D make_jgit.sh jgit.git
....
Updating references:    100% (5760/5760)
...Ref update completed in 148,949 ms.

BFG run is complete!
---

The execution time for the run is completely dominated by the batch ref
update at the end. Repeating the experiment with BFG v1.0.2 (using JGit
patched with this change), the refs update is dramatically reduced:

---
Updating references:    100% (5760/5760)
...Ref update completed in 4,327 ms.

CloneCommand has been creating fetch refspecs like this on bare clones:

[remote ""origin""]
        url = ssh://example.com/my-repo.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/heads//*

As you can see, the destination ref pattern has a superfluous slash.

It looks like this behaviour has always been the case for CloneCommand,
at least since cc2197ed when code catering to bare-clone fetch refspecs
was added. That was released with JGit v1.0 almost 2 years ago, so
there will probably be some bare repos in the wild which will have been
cloned with JGit and have these corrupted refspecs.

The effect of the corrupted fetch refspec is quite interesting. Up to
and including JGit 2.0, the corrupt refspec was tolerated and fetches
would work as intended with no indication to the user that anything was
amiss. With JGit 2.1, a change was introduced which made JGit less
tolerant, and fetches now attempt to update the non-existing ref
""refs/heads//master"". No exception is raised, but the real ref -
""refs/heads/master"" - is not updated.

This behaviour was noticed by a user of Agit (which does bare clones by
default and recently updated from JGit v2.0 to v2.2), reported here:

https://github.com/rtyley/agit/issues/92


If you run C-Git fetch on a bare-repo cloned by JGit, it flat-out
rejects the refspec (checked against v1.7.10.4):

fatal: Invalid refspec '+refs/heads/*:refs/heads//*'

Incidentally, C-Git does not create an explicit fetch refspec at all
when performing a bare clone - the full remote config generated by C-Git
looks like this:

[remote ""origin""]
        url = ssh://example.com/my-repo.git

Using JGit on such a repository works fine, so omitting the fetch
refspec entirely is also an option.

The walk logic does not use RevWalk because it needs to walk all paths
to each of the requested commits, keeping track of each path along which
the commit was found in the RevCommit subclass. From these paths, a
single ""best"" path is chosen based on the total path length, with a
penalty applied for paths that traverse merges.

This functionality parallels ""git name-rev"".

The DHT backend was very slow at parsing objects. To work around
that performance limitation I obfuscated UploadPack by folding both
the want and have sets together in a single parse queue. Since DHT
was removed the complexity is no longer constructive to JGit.

Doing this refactoring prepares the code for a slightly future
change where the have lines need to be handled specially from the
want lines. Splitting the parsing up into two phases makes such
a modification trivial.

Clients send a bunch of unknown objects to UploadPack on each round
of negotiation. Many of these are not known to the server, which
leads the implementation to be looking at indexes for garbage packs.

Disable examining the index of a garbage pack, allowing servers to
avoid reading them from disk during negotiation.

The effect of this change is the server will only ACK a have line
if the object was reachable during the last garbage collection,
or was recently added to the repository. For most repositories
there is no impact in this behavior change.

If a repository rewinds a branch, runs GC, and then resets the
branch back to where it was before, the now current tip is going to
be skipped by this change. A client that has the commit may wind up
getting a slightly larger data transfer from the server as an older
common ancestor will be chosen during negotiation. This is fixable
on the server side by running GC again to correct the layout of
objects in pack files.

Only on Windows the rename operation which renames temporary Packfiles
(and index-files and bitmap-files) sometime fails. This happens only
when renaming a temporary Packfile to a Packfile which already exists.
Such situations occur if you run GC twice on a repo without modifying
the repo inbetween. 

In such situations there was bug in GC which led to a corrupted repo
whithout any packfiles anymore. This commit fixes this problem the hard
way: if a OS rename fails we check source and destination packfile for
content-equality. If they are equal simply delete the source file
instead of trying to rename.

I am searching for a better solution because the content-check is
expensive and the root cause why Windows doesn't allow the rename is not
found. It is proofen that on the source file and the destination file we
don't have any OS FileHandles anymore - but still the rename fails. Unix
and Mac don't see this problem.

When running the garbage collection for a repository it is often
interesting to compare the repository statistics from before and after
the garbage collection to understand the effect of the garbage
collection. This is why it makes sense that the
GarbageCollectionCommand provides a method to retrieve the repository
statistics before running the garbage collection.

So far without running the garbage collection the repository statistics
can only be retrieved by using JGit internal classes. This is what EGit
and Gerrit do at the moment, but it would be better to have an API for
this.

Due to the Git internal sort order a directory is sorted as if it ended
with a '/', this means that the path filter didn't set the last possible
matching entry to the correct value. In the reported issue we had the
following filters.

	org.eclipse.jgit.console
	org.eclipse.jgit

As an optimization we throw a StopWalkException when the walked tree
passes the last possible filter, which was this:
	org.eclipse.jgit.console

Due to the git sorting order, the tree was processed in this order:
	org.eclipse.jgit.console
	org.eclipse.jgit.test
	org.eclipse.jgit

At org.eclipse.jgit.test we threw the StopWalkException preventing the
walk from completing successfully.

A correct last possible match should be:
	org.eclipse.jgit/

For simplicit we define it as:
	org/eclipse/jgit/

This filter would be the maximum if we also had e.g. org and org.eclipse
in the filter, but that would require more work so we simply replace all
characters lower than '/' by a slash.

We believe the possible extra walking does not not warrant the extra
analysis.

Rewrite this complicated logic to examine each pack file exactly
once. This reduces thrashing when there are many large pack files
present and the reader needs to locate each object's header.

The intermediate temporary list is now smaller, it is bounded to
the same length as the input object list. In the prior version of
this code the list contained one entry for every representatio of
every object being packed.

Only one representation object is allocated, reducing the overall
memory footprint to be approximately one reference per object found
in the current pack file (the pointer in the BlockList). This saves
considerable working set memory compared to the prior version that

This implementation has been proven to deadlock in production server
loads. Google has been running with it disabled for a quite a while,
as the bugs have been difficult to identify and fix.

Instead of suggesting it works and is useful, drop the code. JGit
should not advertise support for functionality that is known to
be broken.

In a few of the places where read-ahead was enabled by DfsReader
there is more information about what blocks should be loaded when.
During object representation selection, or size lookup, or sending
object as-is to a PackWriter, or sending an entire pack as-is the
reader knows exactly which blocks are required in the cache, and it
also can compute when those will be needed. The broken read-ahead
code was stupid and just read a fixed amount ahead of the current
offset, which can waste IOs if more precise data was available.

DFS systems are usually slow to respond so read-ahead is still
a desired feature, but it needs to be rebuilt from scratch and
make better use of the offset information.

Garbage is randomly ordered and unlikely to delta compress against
other garbage. Disable delta compression allowing objects to switch
to whole form when moving to the garbage pack.

Because the garbage is not well compressed assume deltas were not
attempted during a normal GC cycle.

Override the reuse settings, garbage that can be reused should be
reused as-is into the garbage pack rather than switching something
like the compression level during a GC. It is intended that garbage
will eventually be removed from the repository so expending CPU
time on a compression switch is not worthwhile.

Free up the WANT_WRITE flag in ObjectToPack by switching the test
to use the special offset value of 1. The Git pack file format
calls for the first 4 bytes to be 'PACK', which means any object
must start at an offset >= 4. Current versions require another 8
bytes in the header, placing the first object at offset = 12.

So offset = 1 is an invalid location for an object, and can be
used as a marker signal to indicate the writing loop has tried
to write the object, but recursed into the base first. When an
object is visited with offset == 1 it means there is a cycle in
the delta base path, and the cycle must be broken.

Some packs built by JGit have incredibly long delta chains due to a
long standing bug in PackWriter. Google has packs created by JGit's
DfsGarbageCollector with chains of 6000 objects long, or more.

Inflating objects at the end of this 6000 long chain is impossible
to complete within a reasonable time bound. It could take a beefy
system hours to perform even using the heavily optimized native C
implementation of Git, let alone with JGit.

Enable pack.cutDeltaChains to be set in a configuration file to
permit the PackWriter to determine the length of each delta chain
and clip the chain at arbitrary points to fit within pack.depth.

Delta chain cycles are still possible, but no attempt is made to
detect them. A trivial chain of A->B->A will iterate for the full
pack.depth configured limit (e.g. 50) and then pick an object to
store as non-delta.

When cutting chains the object list is walked in reverse to try
and take advantage of existing chain computations. The assumption
here is most deltas are near the end of the list, and their bases
are near the front of the list. Going up from the tail attempts to
reuse chainLength computations by relying on the memoized value in
the delta base.

The chainLength field in ObjectToPack is overloaded into the depth
field normally used by DeltaWindow. This is acceptable because the
chain cut happens before delta search, and the chainLength is reset
to 0 if delta search will follow.

If the configuration wants to run 4 threads the delta search work
is initially split somewhat evenly across the 4 threads. During
execution some threads will finish early due to the work not being
split fairly, as the initial partitions were based on object count
and not cost to inflate or size of DeltaIndex.

When a thread finishes early it now tries to take 50% of the work
remaining on a sibling thread, and executes that before exiting.
This repeats as each thread completes until a thread has only 1
object remaining.

Most objects are written as OFS_DELTA with the base in the pack,
that is why this case comes first in writeHeader(). Rewrite the
condition to always examine this first and cache the PackWriter's
formatting flag for use of OFS_DELTA headers, in modern Git networks
this is true more often then it it is false.

Assume the cost of write() is high, especially due to entering the
MessageDigest to update the pack footer SHA-1 computation. Combine
the OFS_DELTA information as part of the header buffer so that the
entire burst is a single write call, rather than two relatively
small ones. Most OFS_DELTA headers are <= 6 bytes, so this rewrite
tranforms 2 writes of 3 bytes each into 1 write of ~6 bytes.

Try to simplify the objectHeader code to reduce branches and use
more local registers. This shouldn't really be necessary if the
compiler is well optimized, but it isn't very hard to clarify data
usage to either javac or the JIT, which may make it easier for the
JIT to produce better machine code for this method.

javac bytecode has a special instruction for this, as it
is very common in software. We can assume the JIT knows
how to efficiently translate the opcode to machine code,
and processors can do != 0 very quickly.

Typical window sizes are 10 and 250.  In either case the pointer
overhead of 1 pointer in an array or 2 pointers for a double linked
list is trivial.  A doubly linked list as used here for window=250 is
only another 1024 bytes on a 32 bit machine.

The critical search loops scan through the array in either the
previous direction or the next direction until the cycle is finished,
or another abort condition is reached.  Loading the next object's
pointer from a field in the current object avoids the branch required
to test for wrapping around the edge of the array.  It also saves the
array bounds check, and does not need to assume this is cheap on the
JVM, nor does it rely on the JIT to be able to see the code always
stays within the bounds.

When a delta is chosen the window is shuffled to save the currently
selected base.  Shuffling the window using a double linked list is
faster than sliding a segment of array entries.

Nicolas Pitre discovered a very simple rule for selecting between two
different delta base candidates:

  - if based whole object, must be <= 50% of target
  - if at end of a chain, must be <= 1/depth * 50% of target

The rule penalizes deltas near the end of the chain, requiring them to
be very small in order to be kept by the packer.  This favors deltas
that are based on a shorter chain, where the read-time unpack cost is
much lower.  Fewer bytes need to be consulted from the source pack
file, and less copying is required in memory to rebuild the object.

Junio Hamano explained Nico's rule to me today, and this commit fixes
DeltaWindow to implement it as described.

When no base has been chosen the computation is simply the statements
denoted above.  However once a base with depth of 9 has been chosen
(e.g.  when pack.depth is limited to 10), a non-delta source may
create a new delta that is up to 10x larger than the already selected
base.  This reflects the intent of Nico's size distribution rule no
matter what order objects are visited in the DeltaWindow.

The improved JGit result for the head pack is only 6.4 KiB larger than
CGit's resulting pack.  This patch allowed JGit to find an additional
39.7 KiB worth of space savings.  JGit now also often runs 2s faster
than CGit, despite also creating bitmaps and pruning objects after the
head pack creation.

TemporaryBuffer is great when the output size is not known, but must
be bound by a relatively large upper limit that fits in memory, e.g.
64 KiB or 20 MiB.  The buffer gracefully supports growing storage by
allocating 8 KiB blocks and storing them in an ArrayList.

In a Git repository many deltas are less than 8 KiB.  Typical tree
objects are well below this threshold, and their deltas must be
encoded even smaller.

For these much smaller cases avoid the 8 KiB minimum allocation used
by TemporaryBuffer.  Instead allocate a very small OutputStream
writing to an array that is sized at the limit.

When an idle thread tries to steal work from a sibling's remaining
toSearch queue, always try to split along a path boundary. This
avoids missing delta opportunities in the current window of the
thread whose work is being taken.

The search order is reversed to walk further down the chain from
current position, avoiding the risk of splitting the list within
the path the thread is currently processing.

When selecting which thread to split from use an accurate estimate
of the size to be taken. This avoids selecting a thread that has
only one path remaining but may contain more pending entries than
another thread with several paths remaining.

Because there is now a race condition where the straggling thread
starts the path before the split can happen the stealWork() loop is
expanded to attempt 4 iterations rather than 2. This simply gives the
idle thread a better chance to observe each sibling's queue and make
a cut while the sibling is busy searching within its active window.

PackWriter generally chooses the order for objects when it builds the
object lists.  This ordering already depends on history information to
guide placing more recent objects first and historical objects last.

Allow PackWriter to make the basic ordering decisions, instead of
trying to override them.  The old approach of sorting the list caused
DfsReader to override any ordering change PackWriter might have tried
to make when repacking a repository.

This now better matches with WindowCursor's implementation, where
PackWriter solely determines the object ordering.

This reverts commit 7aa54967a26cb027fe390ad1c624ebb30f9ac6d5.
The unit test dependend upon the specific order of names that
listFiles() returned members in. The order is completely undefined
and may differ even on different versions of Linux based systems.

A proper unit test for this code would have considered both cases,
where the deletion function was able to remove an empty subdirectory,
or fail to remove a subdirectory because a file was still present
within. This is not such a test.

This corresponds to what C Git does, quoting from the fetch man page:

  This is done by first fetching from the remote using the given
  <refspec>s, and if the repository has objects that are pointed by
  remote tags that it does not yet have, then fetch those missing tags.

Before, JGit would also fetch tags that exist locally but point to a
different object, resulting in REJECTED results for these.

Before this change, JGit returned REJECTED in such a case. Now it
updates it and returns FORCED.

In the DFS implementation, flushing an inserter writes a new pack to
the storage system and is potentially very slow, but was the only way
to ensure previously-inserted objects were available. For some tasks,
like performing a series of three-way merges, the total size of all
inserted objects may be small enough to avoid flushing the in-memory
buffered data. DfsOutputStream already provides a read method to read
back from the not-yet-flushed data, so use this to provide an
ObjectReader in the DFS case.

In the file-backed case, objects are written out loosely on the fly,
so the implementation can just return the existing WindowCursor.

Rewrite LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase's temporary directory code
to use the system specified location and create new unique names.
This prevents fixes between concurrently running tests and allows
the caller to specify the root using java.io.tmpdir.

Update the surefire command lines to use target within each project as
the system temporary directory during unit testing, preventing JGit's
own test suite from writing to /tmp or somewhere like C:\tmp.

There was a severe bug in CommitCommand which could lead to corrupt
repos. When merging an annotated tag the JGit MergeCommand writes
correctly the ID of the tag (and not the id of the commit the tag was
pointing to) into MERGE_HEAD. Native git does the same. But
CommitCommand was reading this file and trusting blindly that it will
contain only IDs of commits. Then the CommitCommand would create a
commit which has as parent a non-commit object (the tag object). That's
so corrupt that even native git gives up when you call ""git log"" in
such a repo.
To reproduce that with EGit simply right-click on a tag in the
Repository View and select Merge. The result was a corrupt repo!

If you look at any implementation of Comparable in the JDK, you'll see
that the type parameter for Comparable is supposed to be the type of
the implementing class:

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html

The current type signature of Comparable<Object> is pretty awful, at the
very least because you can not, in fact, successfully compare
AnyObjectId with any random subclass of Object. It also causes problems
with type-inference and the scala.math.Ordering trait in Scala.

In order to compile, this change *does* require removing the
AnyObjectId.ompareTo(Object) method - which actually only ever cast
to AnyObjectId in any case. Nothing in the JGit test suite requires this
method, but it might constitute a breaking API change, so it would be
best if it can be added in time for JGit 3.0.

Make call() release all private resources so instead of using a
pattern like

	ArchiveCommand cmd = git.archive();
	try {
		cmd.setTree(tree)
			. ...
			.call();
	} finally {
		cmd.release();
	}

callers can just use git.archive().setTree(tree)....call() directly.

This involves pushing more work out of parameter setters and into
call() so the ObjectReader is not allocated and potentially leaked
before then.

Before, it was not clear from the documentation what kind of branch name
was accepted. Users specifying ""branch"" (instead of ""refs/heads/branch"")
got no error message and ended up with a repository without HEAD and no
checkout.

With this, CloneCommand now tries ""$branch"", then ""refs/heads/$branch""
and then ""refs/tags/$branch"". C Git only does the last two, but for
compatibility we should still allow ""refs/heads/branch"".

The original code was able to process only one WWW-Authenticate

could be other headers in the response.

All WWW-Authenticate headers in an HTTP response have to be
browsed to find one of supported, i.e. Basic or Digest.
By that if both are present, the Digest one should be used
as more preferable.

Add a static start() method to FormatActivator to allow outside
classes such as the Archive subcommand of the jgit program can use it
without a BundleContext.  This way, the list of formats only has to be
maintained in one place.

While at it, build a list of registered formats at start() time, so
stop() doesn't have to repeat the same list of formats.

That's because the default longFileMode is LONGFILE_ERROR, which
throws an exception for filenames longer than 100 characters.  Switch
to LONGFILE_POSIX.  While at it, handle large files and filenames with
strange encodings, too.

This requires commons compress 1.4, which introduced support for large
files and POSIX long filenames.

avoid races.

calling setRequestPolicy(ADVERTISED) _after_ calling
setBiDirectionalPipe(true) would have reintroduced the race condition

Associate each RequestPolicy with an implementation of a
RequestValidator interface that contains the validation logic. The
checkWants method is only called if there are wants that were not
advertised, since clients may always request any advertised want
according to the git protocol. Calling the method only once at the
end of parsing the want list also means policy implementations need
not be stateful.

For the special handling of unidirectional pipes, pass a
biDirectionalPipe flag into checkWants, which implementations can use
to delegate to other implementations if necessary.

Reading and writing files formatted like the git-rebase-todo files was
hidden in the RebaseCommand. Certain constructs (like leading
tabs+spaces) have not been handled as native git. Also the upcoming
rebase interactive feature in EGit needs reading/writing these files
independent from a RebaseCommand. Therefore reading and writing those
files has been refactored to the Repository class. RebaseCommand get's
smaller because of that and doesn't have to deal with reading/writing
files.
Additional tests for empty todo-list files, or files containing comments
have been added.

In C Git 1.8.2, ""git reset"" now also works on an unborn branch (no HEAD
yet) if no explicit ref was specified. In that case, it is treated as a
reset to an empty tree.

This can be useful for callers because ""unborn branch"" no longer has to
be special-cased to ""git rm --cached"".

could be other headers in the response.

All WWW-Authenticate headers in an HTTP response have to be
browsed to find one of supported, i.e. Basic or Digest.
By that if both are present, the Digest one should be used
as more preferable.

OpenJDK 7 does not benefit from using an inflate stride on the input
array. The implementation of java.util.zip.Inflater supplies the
entire input byte[] to libz, with no regards for the bounds supplied.
Slicing at 512 byte increments in DfsBlock no longer has any benefit.

In OpenJDK 6 the native portion of Inflater used GetByteArrayRegion
to obtain a copy of the input buffer for libz. In this use case
supplying a small stride made sense, it avoided allocating space
for and copying data past the end of the object's compressed stream.

In OpenJDK 7 the native code uses GetPrimitiveArrayCritical,
which tries to avoid copying by freezing Java garbage collection
and accessing the byte[] contents in place. On OpenJDK 7 derived
JVMs it is likely more efficient to supply the entire DfsBlock.

Since OpenJDK 6 is deprecated and replaced by OpenJDK 7 it is
reasonable to suggest any consumers running JGit with DFS support
use an OpenJDK 7 derived JVM. However, JGit still targets local
filesystem support on Java 5, so it is still not reasonble to apply
this same simplification to the internal.storage.file package.

When there are conflicts with a recursive merge, the conflicting paths
are stored in unmergedPaths (field in ResolveMerger). Later, when the
MergeResult is constructed in MergeCommand, getBaseCommit is called.

In case of RecursiveMerger, getBaseCommit merges the multiple merge
bases into one. It does this not by creating a new ResolveMerger but
instead calling mergeTrees. The problem with mergeTrees is that at the
end, it checks if unmergedPaths is non-empty and returns false in that
case.

Because unmergedPaths was already non-empty because of the real merge,
it thinks that there were conflicts when computing the merge base again,
when there really were none.

This can be fixed by storing the base commit in Merger instead of
computing it a second time for the MergeResult.

Note that another possible fix would be to just use a new ResolveMerger
for merging the merge bases instead. This would also remove the need to
remember the old value of dircache, inCore and workingTreeIterator (see
RecursiveMerger#getBaseCommit).

When it encounters a submodule entry, ""jgit archive"" tries to write
its content verbatim as an entry to the archive, which fails with a
JGitInternalException wrapping a MissingObjectException because the
submodule repository commits are typically not part of the
superproject.

When a subproject is available, it would be nice to recurse into it
and make one archive recording the state of the entire project.
Unfortunately sometimes the subproject is not available and sometimes
it is not obvious where to find the subproject (for example it can be
on another server).  If ""jgit archive"" relied on clones of the
submodules being available on disk in the work tree, then it would not
be usable for repositories without a work tree (for example when
serving from a database) or with not all submodules cloned.

Instead, just skip the submodule entries.  ""git archive"" does the
same.

If during an garbage collection old packfiles are deleted it could
happen that on certain platforms the index file can be deleted but the
packfile can't be deleted (because someone locked the file). This led
to repositories with packfiles without corresponding index files. Those
zombie-packfiles potentially consume a lot of space on disk and it is
never tried to delete them again. Try to avoid this situation by
deleting packfiles first and don't try to delete the other files if we
can't delete the packfile. This gives us the chance to delete the
packfile during next GC.

This commit only improves the situation - there is still the chance for
orphan files during packfile deletion. We don't have an atomic delete
of multiple files .

a hot bit in the cache, which can cause the index to never be unloaded
and seem hotter than it really is. Add a has() method which only
checks if the value is not null and does not update the hot bit.

With this change jgit checks for uncommitted changes before a rebase is
started. This is also done by native git. One reason is that an abort
would override such changes. The check is skipped for a non-interactive
rebase when it will result in a fast-forward. In this case there can be
only checkout conflicts but no merge conflicts, so there cannot be an
abort which overrides uncommitted changes.

JGit was not handling certain file/folder conflicts during a checkout
correctly. This was reported by Axel Richard in
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg02358.html.
This commit fixes this problem.

Still JGit behaves intentionally different then native git.
If HEAD contains a tree, and workingtree, Index and Merge contain a file
with same content ... then JGit allows a conflict free checkout of
Merge. Native git always complains that it doesn't want to overwrite
local changes. But there is no need to update the working tree because
Index and Merge are already equal.

A shell script which shows how native git behaves can be found here.

This is the case for submodules in .git/modules, which typically have a

try to call Repository.stripWorkDir with it.

This reverts commit 1def0a1257d32bce08e751242733cda3b2036cb8.

We found this fix uncovers problems with unsmudged DirCacheEntry's. This
surfaced because egit's ui test CreatePatchActionTest failed since jgit
computes a wrong status. JGit doesn't detect modified content in now
unsmudged entries. Hence revert this change until these problems are
fixed.

Blaming with core.autocrlf set to 'auto' - even for freshly checked out
files - showed all lines as being locally modified. For autocrlf = true
the line breaks of the local file will be converted to LF for blaming.
This results in useful diffs and therefor in the desired blame
annotations.

For autocrlf = input no conversion takes place to cope with CRLF line
breaks in the repository, in addition to the usual LF. For autocrlf =
true CRLF line breaks in the repo can't be supported without additional
effort. In that case the whole local file will be blamed as being
locally modified.

The ""cut off"" optimization causes it to not include branches that
contain the specified commit but happen to share commits with a branch
that does not contain the commit.

An example:

      -B foo
        \
    -A---C master

findBranchesReachableFrom for commit A with both branches as input may
not return master (depending on the order of the input). The reason is
that A is not contained in foo, and therefore the old code would put B
in the cutOff set. When then walking the master commits and B is
checked, it is found in the cutOff set and the walk is aborted, causing
master not to be returned even though it should.

Formerly the 4-arg constructor did not do this, which was unfortunate
as that constructor's the only way for an external user of JGit to set
the /type/ of the ref-update - which you might want to do to indicate
that the update is expected to be a UPDATE_NONFASTFORWARD, and thus does
not require expensive isMergedInto() calculations:

When the caller specifies to JGit in advance that a ref-update is a

need to call the potentially expensive isMergedInto() check. Re-checking
that the older commit is /not/ reachable from the newer is superfluous.

In certain cases a JGit server updating an existing shallow client
selected a common ancestor that was behind the shallow edge of
the client. This allowed the server to assume the client had some
objects it did not have and allowed creation of pack deltas the
client could never inflate.

Any commit the client has advertised as shallow must be treated
by UploadPack server as though it has no parents. With no parents
the walker cannot visit graph history the client does not have,
and PackWriter cannot consider delta base candidates the client
is lacking.

Johannes Carlsson identified a race condition[1] that can lead to
spurious MissingObjectExceptions at read time. If two threads are
active inside of ObjectDirectory looking for a packed object and the
packList is currently the empty NO_PACKS list, thread A will find
no object and eventually consider tryAgain1(). If thread A is put
to sleep and this point and thread B also does not find the object,
loads the packs, when thread A wakes up its tryAgain1 would return
false and the thread never considers the packs.

Rework the internal API of ObjectDirectory to keep a handle on the
exact PackList that was iterated by thread A, allowing it to always
retry walking through the packs if the new PackList is different.

This had some ripple effect into the CachedObjectDirectory and
the shared FileObjectDatabase interface. The new code should be
slightly easier to follow, especially from the perspective of the
CachedObjectDirectory trying to minimize the number of open system
calls it makes to files matching ""$GIT_DIR/objects/??/?x{38}"".

When git-core renames or copies a file and the mode differs the

JGit relies on this ordering inside of FileHeader. Parsing ""new file
mode NNN"" after ""copy from/to"" or ""rename from/to"" resets the change
type to be ADD, losing the COPIED or RENAMED status and old path.

This fixes a 4 year old bug in Gerrit Code Review that prevents
opening a file for review if the file was copied from another file,
modified in this change, and the mode was updated (e.g. execute
bit was added).

Previously all HTTP communication was done with the help of
java.net.HttpUrlConnection. In order to make JGit usable in environments
where the direct usage of such connections is not allowed but where the
environment provides other means to get network connections an
abstraction for connections is introduced. The idea is that new
implementations of this interface will be introduced which will not use
java.net.HttpUrlConnection but use e.g.
org.apache.client.http.HttpClient to provide network connections.

One example: certain cloud infrastructures don't allow that components
in the cloud communicate directly with HttpUrlConnection. Instead they
provide services where a component can ask for a connection (given a
symbolic name for the destination) and where the infrastructure returns
a preconfigured org.apache.http.client.HttpClient. In order to allow
JGit to be running in such environments we need the abstraction
introduced in this commit.

This change implements the http connection abstraction with the help of
org.apache.http.client.HttpClient. The default implementation used by
JGit is still the JDK HttpURLConnection. But now JGit users have the
possibility to switch completely to org.apache.httpclient. The reason
for this is that in certain (e.g. cloud) environments you are forced to
use the org.apache classes.

Sun HttpURLConnection is able to handle authentication like SPNEGO without
caller intervention. However, there are some restrictions:
- do not need user intervention (user,password for example)
- it doesn't work when request body is chunked/streamed (because it cannot be
replayed)

Unfortunately there is no real way to leverage HttpURLConnection authentication
work as the authentication header is stripped off the request before returning
to the caller. There's also no way to disable explicitly authentication in
HttpURLConnection (SPNEGO auth will always be attempted if a valid token can be
created by GSSAPI).

This is an issue for jgit since it is expected that the first request will be
used to detect authentication method, and reuse for the subsequent requests.

This patch modifies TransportHTTP to detect authentication done in the background
by HttpURLConnection and sets the jgit authentication method accordingly so it will
always work for future requests (assuming that the authentication method used by
HttpURLConnection is also supported by jgit).

During a checkout we want to prevent to overwrite unsaved local file
content. Jgit was therefore checking wheter the file to overwrite is
dirty or missing and would raise a conflict it this was the case. That
was wrong. It should only check that the file is dirty. It's ok to
""overwrite"" a missing/non-existing file.

Copying flags through a graph with deep side branches can cause
StackOverflowError. The recursive step to visit the 2nd parent of
a merge commit can overflow the stack if these are themselves very
deep histories with many branches.

Rewrite the loop to iterate up to 500 recursive steps deep before
unwinding the stack and running the remaining parts of the graph
using a dynamically allocated FIFORevQueue.

This approach still allows simple graphs that mostly merge short
lived topic branches into master to copy flags with no dynamic
memory allocation, relying only on temporary stack extensions.
Larger more complex graphs only pay the allocation penalities
if copying has to extend outwards ""very far"" in the graph, which
is unlikely for many coloring based algorithms.

if M (tip) was compared to 1 (base), the method
isMergedInto() could still return false, since
two mergeBases will be detected and the return
statement will only look at one of them:

  return next() == base;

In most cases this would pass, but if ""A"" is
a commit with an old timestamp, the Generator
would walk down to ""2"" before completing the
walk pass ""A"" and first finding the other
merge base ""1"". In this case, the first call to
next() returns 2, which compared to base evaluates
as false.

This is fixed by iterating merge bases and
returning true if base is found among them.

There are certain ref names which native git can be create only on
non-windows systems (e.g. ""refs/tags/>""). On Windows systems we can't
persist this refs because the ref names are not valid file names. Our
tests in ValidRefNameTest assumed that these are valid refs on all
systems. This broke the tests on Windows.

Problem:
The BlameGenerator used the RevFlag SEEN to mark commits it had already
looked at (but not necessarily processed), to prevent processing a
commit multiple times. If a commit is a conflicting merge that
contains lines of the merge base, that have been deleted in its first
parent, either these lines or the lines untouched since the merge base
would not be blamed properly.

This happens e.g. if a file is modified on a main branch in an
earlier commit M and on a side branch in a later commit S. For this
example, M deletes some lines relative to the common base commit B, and
S modifies a subset of these lines, leaving some other of these lines
untouched,

Then side is merged into main, creating a conflict for these lines. The
merge resolution shall carry over some unmodified lines from B that
would otherwise be deleted by M. The route to blame these lines is via S
to B. They can't be blamed via M, as they don't exist there anymore.

Blaming the merged file first blames via S, because that is the later
commit. Doing so, it also looks at B to blame the unmodified lines of B
carried over by S into the merge result. In the course of this, B is
submitted for later processing and marked SEEN.

Later M is blamed. It notices that its parent commit B has been SEEN and
aborts processing for M. B is blamed after that, but only for the lines
that survived via S.

As a result, only the lines contributed by S or by B via S are
blamed. All the other lines that were unchanges by both M and S, which
should have been blamed to B via M, are not blamed.

Solution:
Don't abort processing when encountering a SEEN commit. Rather add the
new region list of lines to be blamed to those of the already SEEN and
enqueued commit's region list. This way when the B commit of the
above example is processed, it will blame both the lines of M and S,
yielding a complete blame result.

BlameGenerator.push(Candidate) now also looks at the ancestor
relationship if candidates have the same commit time. This ensures that
children are pop()-ed before their parents.

Avoid converting the raw mode to FileMode. This is an expensive
if-else-if sort of test to just check if the thing is a blob.
Instead test the bit mask directly, which is at least a few
instructions shorter.

The TreeWalk is already recursive and will auto-dive into any
subtrees found. isSubtree check is unnecessary, as is the loop,
as only one result will ever be returned by next().

With this commit running blame on render_view_impl.cc[1] saves
about 644 ms over prior versions, reducing the time about 4.5%.

Large projects often contain strands of commits where no changes
are made to a particular subtree. Blame used to dive recursively
into these subtrees to look for the blob and check if its SHA-1
was changed. In chromium/src[1] only 20% of the commits modify
the content/renderer subtree relevant for the file.

The recursivePath is necessary to check for '/' and remember
if common subtree elimination should be attempted. When a file
lives within a subtree the extra cost to check for unmodified
subtrees saves time. However for files in the root tree the
extra work incurred by TreeWalk is not worthwhile and would
significantly increase overall running time.

Now typical running times from an otherwise idle desktop:

to speed it up.

<RFC>
 I'd like to hear your feedback on the commit graph layouts plotted by
this change (e.g. in EGIt's History view). If it is well received, I
will further split up this commit for easier review.
</RFC>

The aim of this change is to place all commits of a branch on the same
lane and commits of other (side) branches on different lanes.

The algorithm treats first parents of a commit specially by placing them
on the same lane as the commit itself. When a commit is the first parent
of multiple children it could be placed on any of these childrens'
lanes. In this case it is placed on the longest child lane, as this is
usually the lane of the branch the commit actually was made on.

Other (non-first) parents are placed on new lanes. This creates a layout
that should make it easier to see branches and merges and follow linear
branch histories.
This differs from the previous approach, which sometimes plotted the
commits of a branch on the same lane as the base branch commits
and further commits on the base branch appeared on a different lane.
This made the base branch appear as if it was the side branch and
the side branch appear to be the base branch.

In addition to lane assignment, also the plotting code changed to start
drawing a branch lane from the commit where it forks out. Previously it
started only when the first commit on the branch appeared.

When blaming a merge commit with ""Ignore whitespace changes"" enabled,
don't discard blame candidates for other parents when we encounter a
parent that only has whitespace changes compared to the merge result.

The algorithm early prepares parents for blaming, removing the
appropriate blame regions from the list of regions still to blame. Only
at the end, the prepared blame candidates are submitted for blaming.

When looking at a non-first parent, which only differs in whitespace to
the merge result, it submitted that parent, but only to blame for the
(usually few) lines not already blamed on other parents. Due to an early
return, the blame candidates for the previous parents were forgotten,
leaving many lines unannotated.

Previously, setting any TreeFilter on a RevWalk triggered parent
rewriting, which in the current StartGenerator implementation ends up
buffering the entire commit history in memory. Aside from causing poor
performance on large histories, This does not match the default
behavior of `git rev-list`, which does not rewrite parent SHAs unless
asked to via --parents/--children.

Add a new method setRewriteParents() to RevWalk to disable this
behavior. Continue rewriting parents by default to maintain backwards
compatibility.

Child commits always have a lane assigned when their parents are
processed, so this code is no longer necessary.

Children only assign themselves to parents in
PlotCommitList.setupChildren(), which is called from enter(), when the
child is processed. If the child leaves enter() it should always have a
lane assigned. As a result of this, when processing a parent, all its
known children already have lanes assigned. If the underlying RevWalk
emits a parent before one of its children (which it should not do), the
parent does not know of the child emitted later, because setupChildren()
has not been called for the child yet. So even in this case, no child
without a lane is encountered when processing a (parent) commit.

Stepping past the '.git' entry with `fti.next(1)` is unnecessary and in
fact a bug, as the subsequent access to FileTreeIterator is past it's
end-of-file - it has only 1 valid entry ('link').

Theses tests are all working with a small repo that has just two entries:
'.git' and 'link' (a symbolic link that's being tested on). `listFiles()`
is called by FileTreeIterator to get a preliminary list of FileEntry
objects:

https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/blob/6d724dcd/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java#L139

Whether your tests appeared to pass or fail was dependent on the returned
order of files from `listFiles()`:

* ['.git', 'link'] - PASS (Eclipse Hudson appears to get this ordering)
* ['link', '.git'] - FAIL (My env, Ubuntu 14.04/Java 1.7.0_55)

The tree-iterator passes the resulting `FileEntry`s to it's init() method:

https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/blob/6d724dcd/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java#L639-L665

... where a count of valid entries is made (`entryCnt`), the 'invalid'
entries (like'.git') being left in the hinterland of the `entries` array.
The rearrangement in the entries array for our tests looks like this:

* ['.git', 'link'] -> ['link', 'link']
* ['link', '.git'] -> ['link', '.git']

In both cases, `entryCnt` is set to 1, meaning that the _valid_ portion of
the iterator is the same (ie ['link']), but that the portion after EOF,
which we reach by calling `fti.next(1)`, is _different_ depending on your
environment. The entry used by the iterator at that point will be either
'link' (if you're lucky) or '.git', which will blow up the test.

Note that somewhat ironically, the 'self-check' assertions don't catch
this bug, as 'path' data is only parsed _before_ EOF - so
`fti.getEntryPathString()` returns the string ""link"" (and the assertion
passes) regardless of whether you're about to read the '.git' entry or not.

0b5441a8 introduced an enum for authentication types and changed the
case of digest and basic authentication type names to all uppercase.
This broke digest authentication at least when using Gerrit as the git
server. According to RFC2617 [1] ""Basic"" and ""Digest"" have to be used
and not ""BASIC"" [1] and ""DIGEST"" [2].

unnecessary casting, and probably nicer to avoid the repetition too.

TranslationBundle#load() used to load resource bundles through
ResourceBundle#getBundle() without explicitly specifying a class loader.
In this case, the class laoder of the calling class (TranslationBundle
here) is used. This approach fails in runtime environments like OSGi
where there are multiple class loaders.

This change enables loading resource bundles in multi class loaders
environments. The fix is to passes the class loader of the
TranslationBundle-derived class to ResourceBundle#getBundle().

Originally, blame's walk to find a scapegoat to blame for a file
walking backward from a commit used the test

	treeWalk.getFileMode(0).getObjectType() != OBJ_BLOB

to throw out gitlink (submodule) entries.  Later, 52500d3264d2 (blame:
Micro optimize blob lookup in tree, 2014-04-17) changed that test to

	(treeWalk.getRawMode(0) & TYPE_FILE) != TYPE_FILE

These checks are not the same, though: the older test accepts files
and symlinks, while the newer one accepts files, symlinks, and gitlink
(submodule) entries.  This is particularly broken in the submodule
case --- trying to parse the referred-to commit as a blob produces

	caught an exception: GET /gerrit/+blame/master/plugins/reviewnotes HTTP/1.1
	org.eclipse.jgit.errors.MissingObjectException: Missing blob 61702414c046dd6b811c9137b765f9db422f83db

Stick to just (possibly executable) files instead.  Symlinks are not
line-oriented data so blame on a symlink is not likely to be useful.

A quick grep for '& TYPE_' doesn't find any other instances of this
bug.

The current behavior of passing a TreeFilter to RevWalk has limited
usefulness, since the RevFilter derived from the TreeFilter is always
ANDed together with any other RevFilters. It is also tied fairly
tightly to the parent rewriting mechanism.

Make TreeRevFilter a generic RevFilter that matches modified paths
against any TreeFilter. This allows for more complex logic like
(modified this path OR authored by this person).

Leave the rewrite flag logic in this class, since it's closely tied to
the parent comparison code, but hidden behind a protected constructor.

Connecting to an SshSession may fail due to different reasons. Jsch for 
example often throws an com.jcraft.jsch.JschException: verify: false.[1]
The issue is still not fixed in JSch 0.1.51.
 
In such a case it is worth retrying to connect. 

Two retries should be sufficient.

parents, discarding the old merge commit. For the common use-case of
pull with rebase this is unfortunate, as it loses the merge conflict
resolution (and other fixes in the merge), which may have taken quite
some time to get right in the first place.

To overcome this we use a two-fold approach:
If any of the (non-first) merge parents of a merge were rewritten, we
also redo the merge, to include the (potential) new changes in those
commits.
If only the first parent was rewritten, i.e. we are merging a branch
that is otherwise unaffected by the rebase, we instead cherry-pick the
merge commit at hand. This is done with the --mainline 1 and --no-commit
options to apply the changes introduced by the merge. Then we set up an
appropriate MERGE_HEAD and commit the result, thus effectively forging a
merge.

Apart from the approach taken to rebase merge commits, this
implementation closely follows C Git. As a result, both Git
implementations can continue rebases of each other.

Preserving merges works for both interactive and non-interactive rebase,
but as in C Git it is easy do get undesired outcomes with interactive
rebase.

CommitCommand supports committing merges during rebase now.

When RecursiveMerger tried to determine a common base tree it was
recursively tried to merge multiple common bases. But these intermediate
merges which have just been done to determine a single common base for
the final merge already filled some important fields (toBeCheckedOut,
toBeDeleted, ...). These sideeffects of the intermediate merges led to
wrong results of the final merge. One sympton was that after a recursive
merge which should be succesfull you could still see leftofer files in
the worktree: files which existed in the (virtual) common base but which
don't exist anymore in the branches to be merged.

Solution is easy: Clear the appropriate fields after common base
determination and start the final merge with a clean state.

Previously when RecursiveMerger was trying to create a single virtual
common base for the merge it was failing when this lead to content-merge
conflicts. This is different from what native git is doing. When native
git's recursive merge algorithm creates a new common base it will merge
the multiple parents and simply take the merge result (potentially
including conflict markers) as common base. See my discussion with Shawn
here: http://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg234959.html :

  > - How should workingtree, index (stage1,2,3) look like if during

  Its done entirely in memory and never touches the working tree or
  index. When a conflict exists in the X1-X2 merge the conflict is
  preserved into the new virtual base.
  
There is still the possibility that the merge of parents lead to
conflicts. File/Folder conclicts, conflicts on filemodes. This commit
only fixes the situation for conflicts when merging content.

In change If45bc3d078b3d3de87b758e71d7379059d709603 a new parameter was
added to 3 protected methods of ResolveMerger. This breaks the code of
developers which have subclassed ResolveMerger. The API Baselinecheck in
Eclipse reports this as API breakage.

Since this will break only Providers but not Consumers of the API this
should be allowed also in minor versions. See semantic versioning doc
http://www.osgi.org/wiki/uploads/Links/SemanticVersioning.pdf

Therefore I added these modifications to the API filter rules.

Either set it to an absolute number e.g. ""4"" or in units of

use 4 cores on a 8 core system or ""1C"" to use all 8 cores on

Using the ObjectWalk and marking a commit as uninteresting didn't mark
its root tree as uninteresting. This caused the ""missing tree ...""
error in Gerrit under special circumstances. For example, if the
patch-set 2 changes only the commit message then the patch-set 1
and patch-set 2 share the same root level tree:

  ps1 -> o   o <- ps2
          \ /
           o root-tree

The transported pack will contain the ps2 commit but not the root-tree
object.

When using the receive.checkReferencedObjectsAreReachable Gerrit will
check the reachability of all referenced objects not provided in the
transported pack. Since the ps1 was advertised it will properly be
marked as uninteresting. However, the root-tree was reachable because
the ObjectWalk.markUninteresting missed to mark it as uninteresting.
Gerrit will then reject the pack with the ""missing tree ..."" exception.

The native implementation of inflate() can set finished to return
true at the same time as it copies the last bytes into the buffer.

Check for finished on each iteration, terminating as soon as libz
knows the stream was completely inflated.

If not finished, it is likely input is required before the next
native call could do any useful work. Most invocations are passing
in a buffer large enough to store the entire result. A partial return
from inflate() will need more input before it can continue. Checking
right away that needsInput() is true saves a native call to determine
no bytes can be inflated without more input.

This should fix a rare infinite loop condition inside of inflation.
If the inflater was fed the entire pack, and the pack was smaller
than one block size the loop could run forever. The inflater could
set 0 bytes input remaining, which sets needsInput() true. As the
stream is finished each new attempt to inflate() returns n == 0,
as no additional bytes were output. The needsInput() test tries to
add the length of this block to itself, but then loops back around
an reloads the same block as the block is smaller than a full block
size. A zero length input is set to the inflater, which triggers
needsInput() condition again.

optimize the repository at the expense of taking much more time.
Technically a aggressive mode garbage collection differs from a

- not reusing packed objects found in old packs. Recompress every object
- the configuration pack.window is set to 250 (the default is 10)
- the configuration pack.depths is set to 250 (the default is 50)

The associated classes in org.eclipse.jgit.api and the command line
command in org.eclipse.jgit.pgm expose this new option.

The configuration parameters gc.aggressiveDepth and gc.aggressiveWindow
have been introduced to configure this feature.

When writing new packs it should be allowed to specify objects as ""have""
(objects which should not be included in the pack) which do not exist in
the local repo. This works find with traditional PackWriter, but when
PackWriter was working on a repo with bitmap indexes and used
PackWriterBitmapWalker then this feature was broken. Non-existing ""have""
objects lead to MissingObjectExceptions. That broke e.g. gerrit
replication. When the replication target had branches unknown to the
replication source then the source repository wants to build pack files
where ""have"" included these branch-tips which where unknown in the
source repository.

Applications sometimes use a RevFlag instead of a Set<RevObject>
to track boolean state bits about objects being processed. However
this requires careful use of the resetRetain() methods to avoid an
accidental clearing of the RevFlag bits, effectively clearing the
Set<RevObject> the application wanted to track.

Simplify that use case by offering retainOnReset, a collection of
flags that are never cleared by the RevWalk.

For each submodule native git allows to configure which modifications to
submodules should be ignored by the status command. It is possible to
ignore ""none"", ""all"", ""dirty"", ""untracked"" [1]. This configuration is
now supported by IndexDiff. The StatusCommand offers the possibility to
specify this mode.

Before a rebase happens the RebaseCommand checks that the workingtree is
clean. We don't want to start a rebase on a dirty worktree. If the
worktree is dirty a rebase should not be allowed. But RebaseCommand
should ignore modifications done to submodules. E.g. if a submodules
HEAD points to <x> but the root repository has in index that the
submodule should point to <y> then this should not prohibit a rebase.
Also native git allows a rebase in this case. Since jgit's StatusCommand
has learned to ignore submodule changes this is now used by the
RebaseCommand to determine the repository state correctly.

The change tries to make jgit behave more like native CLI git regarding

JGit's ObjectDirectory implements the optimization that it remembers the
pack folders (.git/objects/pack) lastModified timestamp and doesn't
check for new packfiles in this folder if the lastModified attribute has
not changed.
In environments using NFS this can cause trouble. If multiple JGit
instances from multiple machines work on the same repository and one
instance creates a new ref and a new packfile (e.g. by doing a fetch)
then the other machines may detect the new ref but can't resolve the
referenced object because it doesn't detect that pack folder has a new
packfile. That's because NFS may cache file/folder metadata for quite a
long time and the pack folders modification time is not updated although
a new packfile is there and could be read.

The new config parameter core.trustfolderstat controls this behaviour.
The default is true and jgits behaviours is unchanged. But if this
parameter is set to false then jgit doesn't trust the pack directories
lastmodified anymore. Instead it will always iterate through the content
of that folder to detect new packfiles.

If the text extent height of a to be rendered plot line is odd, then the
SWTPlotRenderer cannot calculate the correct Y position for drawing the
label and draws the label with a 1 pixel offset. SWT text drawing uses
the baseline as Y coordinate. Due to the given centerline API in the
AbstractPlotRenderer the overall calculation of the baseline for SWT is
effectively (height / 2) * 2, thereby rounding all odd heights downward
to the next even number.

This change pushes the division by 2 from the caller into the
implementations of drawText. A corresponding change will be pushed in
the egit repository.

The bulk of the ""is this sane"" logic is inside of ObjectChecker.  The
only caller for the version in DirCacheCheckout is an obtuse usage for
the static isValidRefName() method in Repository.

Deprecate the weird single use method in DirCacheCheckout and move all
code for checking a sequence of path components into ObjectChecker,
where it makes sense alongside the existing code that checks a single
component at a time.

Reuse a single ObjectChecker for the local platform, to avoid looking
up the system properties on each path string considered.

Gitiles malfunctions in conjunction with jgit and guice
because of a recent guice bug fix. Work around the problem
by parsing the URI directly, bypassing the unescaping
performed by the getPathInfo method.

This rest of this message is copied from
https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/60820/ :

The fix for Guice issue #745[1] causes getPathInfo() within the
GuiceFilter to return decoded values, eliminating the difference
between ""foo/bar"" and ""foo%2Fbar"". This is in spec with the servlet
standard, whose javadoc for getPathInfo[2] states that the return
value be ""decoded by the web container"".

Work around this by extracting the path part directly from the request
URI, which is unmodified by the container. This is copying the Guice
behavior prior to the bugfix. We do this with a static method rather
than using our own HttpServletRequestWrapper as we don't want to
produce a request wrapper that is not in spec.

Native git's ""init"" command allows to specify the location of the .git

setup repositories with a non-standard layout. E.g. .git folder under
/repos/a.git and the worktree under /home/git/a. Both directories
contain pointers to the other side: /repos/a.git/config contains
core.worktree=/home/git/a . And /home/git/a/.git is a file containing
""gitdir: /repos/a.git"". This commit adds that option to InitCommand.

This reverts commit 19f869996f27adf59ec507e5f565d8b5619576f3.
Leaving path info encoded confuses applications like Gitiles.
Trying to fix this inside of JGit was maybe the wrong solution.

SystemReader used a chached ObjectChecker which was instantiated only
once. But in case of unit tests where we can change the platform
dynamically (e.g. MockSystemReader.setWindows()) this is wrong and
caused DirCacheCheckoutMaliciousPathTest.testMaliciousAbsoluteCurDrivePathWindowsOnUnix()
to fail. This change allows user of SystemReader to force the creation
of a new ObjectChecker. MockSystemReader.setWindows() and .setUnix()
make use of this feature.

The path matcher should not fail if the rule ends with trailing slash,
target pattern does not ends with the slash and the ""assumeDirectory""
flag is set.

E.g. */bin/ should also match a/bin if this pattern is threated as
directory by WorkingTreeIterator (FileMode.TREE).

The old code/tests have never tested directory rules with patterns
*without* trailing slashes but with the ""assumeDirectory"" flag set.
Unfortunately this is exactly what WorkingTreeIterator does... The tests
are changed to test *both* cases now (with trailing slash and without)
if the target pattern has trailing slash (represents directory).

This changes PersonIdent#toExternalString() to trim name and email

If the IOException is caused by a transient problem that's maybe the
better strategy to avoid the problem reported on the Gerrit list [1].
It looks like in the reported case the pack was removed from the pack
list causing MissingObjectExceptions which disappear when the server is
restarted.

In case the index contains wrong tree extensions don't throw a
ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception but revalidate the tree extension.

It happened that the git index written by Git for Windows contained valid
(means entryCount>0) tree extensions for pathes which are not existing
in the index. Native git handles this inconsistency silently but JGit
was crashing with a ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception. Teach JGit to
better recognize such cases and revalidate such extensions.

It's hard to write a test because JGit doesn't write such extensions. It
only reads, validates and makes use of them. But the bug tells how to
create such situations.

Current ArchiveCommand design doesn't allow to pass in options to
underlying stream implementations. To overcome this, client has to
implement custom format implementation (it cannot be derived from
the existing one, because the classies are marked as final), and
set the options using ThreadLocal, before the method

  createArchiveOutputStream(OutputStream s)

is get called.

This change extends the ArchiveCommand.Format by allowing to pass
option map during creation of ArchiveOutputStream.

ArchiveCommand is extended correspondingly. That way client can
easily pass options to the underlying streams:

  Map<String, Object> level = ImmutableMap.<String, Object> of(
      ""level"", new Integer(9));
  new ArchiveCommand(repo)
      .setFormat(""zip"")
      .setFormatOptions(level)
      .setTree(tree)
      .setPaths(paths)
      .setPrefix(prefix)
      .setOutputStream(sidebandOut)
      .call();

The ""Target Platform Definition DSL and Generator"" [1] heavily
simplifies maintenance of target platforms. It allows to modularize
target platform definitions which eliminates code duplication. The
.target files understood by P2 and Tycho are generated from .tpd files
which are written in the target platform definition DSL.

In order to edit .tpd files and generate .target files install the
""Target Platform Definition DSL and Generator"" 2.0 or later [2]  (Note:
on Kepler you also need to add [3] to get Xtext 2.5 which is not
available by default on Kepler). This tools is needed only if you need
to change the Target Platform definition files (*.targetplatform and
*.tpd) and re-generate the *.target files. In normal development you do
not need this and can simply use the generated *.target themselves.

In addition
- update Orbit repository for 4.5 to Mars M5
- use latest released Orbit p2 repository for platform version Luna
  and earlier

Since 27ae8bc65 Git has implemented AutoCloseable, which means Eclipse
may warn if close() is never called on a Git instance. For example,
the following would result in a resource warning:

  Repository repo = openRepository(foo);
  Git git = new Git(repo);
  try {
    git.someCommand().call();
  } finally {
    repo.close();
  }

(The same warning would occur if repo were created in a try-with-
resources block.)

The ""obvious"" fix is to open git in a try-with-resources block:

  try (Repository repo = openRepository(foo);
      Git git = new Git(repo)) {
    git.someCommand().call();
  }

Unfortunately, this construction was subtly broken: it would call both
git.close() and repo.close(), but git.close() would call repo.close()
again. Depending on the repository implementation, this might or might
not be ok. If it's not ok, it might not immediately cause an error, if
the reference count of repo was >2 at the time of closing.

Of course, explicitly calling git.close() followed by repo.close() in
two finally blocks would has had the same double-closing problem since
forever. But the problem became worse when Git started implementing
AutoCloseable, because now Eclipse is _actively encouraging_
developers to change working code into broken code.

To work around this, keep track in Git's constructor of whether the
repository was passed in or opened at construction time, and only
close the repository if it was opened by Git.

Note that in the original example, there was not _actually_ a resource
leak, since repo was closed exactly once; git did not _need_ to be
closed in this case. But at least fixing this false-positive warning
no longer introduces a real bug.

Callers may wish to use TemporaryBuffer as an essentially unbounded
buffer by passing Integer.MAX_VALUE as the size. (This makes it
behave like ByteArrayOutputStream, only without requiring contiguous
memory.) Unfortunately, it was always allocating an array in the
backing block pointer list to hold enough blocks to MAX_VALUE--all
262,016 of them. It wasn't allocating the blocks themselves, but this
array was still extremely wasteful, using about 2MiB of memory on a
64-bit system.

Tweak the interface to specify an estimated size, and only allocate
the block pointer list enough entries to hold that size. It's an
ArrayList, so if that estimate was wrong, it'll grow. We assume the
cost of finding enough contiguous memory to grow that array is
acceptable.

While we're in there, fix an off-by-one error: due to integer division
we were undercounting the number of blocks needed to store n bytes of
data as (n / SZ).

The block pointer list may have been relatively large, so no need to
make more garbage. Instead, just clear the list and null out all the
elements.

Another possible motivation: a caller may have provided an inaccurate
estimated size, so the list might have been resized several times. If
the list is reused later for a similarly underestimated workload, this
fix will prevent additional resizing on subsequent usages.

This reverts commit 6bc48cdc62287934ce1b7003280b19a5994e7668.

Until git v1.7.10.2~29^2~1 (builtin/merge.c: reduce parents early,
2012-04-17), C git merge would make merge commits with duplicate parents
when asked to with a series of commands like the following:

  git checkout origin/master
  git merge --no-ff origin/master

Nowadays ""git merge"" removes redundant parents more aggressively
(whenever one parent is an ancestor of another and not just when
duplicates exist) but merges with duplicate parents are still permitted
and can be created with git fast-import or git commit-tree and history
viewers need to be able to cope with them.

CommitBuilder is an interface analagous to commit-tree, so it should
allow duplicate parents.  (That said, an option to automatically remove
redundant parents would be useful.)

When RecursiveMerger found that there are multiple base-commits for the
commits to be merged it tries to temporarily merge the base commits. But
if these base commits have no common predecessor there was a bug in JGit
leading to a NPE. This commit fixes this by enforcing that an empty tree
is used as base when merging two unrelated base commits.

This logic was already there when merging two commits which have no
common predecessor (ThreeWayMerger.mergeBase()). But the code which was
computing a new temporary base commit in case of criss-cross merges
didn't take care to pick an empty tree when no common predecessor can be
found.

Formatting merge conflicts one byte at a time is going to be very
slow when the final OutputStream is a FileOutputStream and the JVM
is making system calls for each byte output.

When outputting a range of bytes from a byte[] the bol (beginning
of line) value only depends on the value of the last byte written.
Other bytes in the array can be passed directly to the lower stream
for more efficient output.

Most callers/users of TemporaryBuffer are sizing the in-memory
portion large enough that most outputs fit into RAM. With this
assumption they don't pay close attention to the size of IOs
being written, as it ""should"" just be a copy from one byte array
to another.

Overflow sets up a local file handle, which is costly to write to
for small IO units. Wrap the local file in a BufferedOutputStream
to combine small writes together. Larger writes can still bypass the
buffer as BOS automatically avoids copying for larger writes.

Pack not found and pack corrupted/invalid are handled by the code (pack
is removed from the list) so logging an error and the stacktrace is
misleading because it implies that there is an action to take to fix the
error.

Lower the log level to warn and remove the stacktrace for those 2 types
of errors and keep the error log statement for any other.

This error happens on nfs file system when you try to read a file that
was deleted or replaced.

When the error happens because the file was deleted, removing it from
the list is the proper way to handle the error, same use case as
FileNotFoundException. When the error happens because the file was
replaced, removing the file from the list will cause the file to be
re-read so it will get the latest version of the file.

As Chris pointed out change I822721c76c64e614f87a080ced2457941f53adcd
slowed down merge since ANY_DIFF filter is much less efficient than the
manual detection of diffs done in ResolveMerger.processEntry() since it
avoids unnecessary filesystem calls using the git index. Hence only set
the ANY_DIFF filter on bare repositories which don't have a working tree
to scan.

To test performance I used the setup described in Chris' comment on
change I822721c76c64e614f87a080ced2457941f53adcd and modified
ResolveMerger.mergeTrees() to not add the working tree in order to
simulate merging in a bare repository.

At least on Mac I couldn't detect a speedup, with and without the
ANY_DIFF filter merge test takes in average 0.67sec. I will try the same
test on a larger repo tomorrow.

Cached packs are only used when writing over the network or to

two contexts. The client/consumer of the stream will be SHA-1
checksumming every object.

Reuse validation is most critical during local GC to avoid silently
ignoring corruption by stopping as soon as a problem is found and
leaving everything alone for the end-user to debug and salvage.
Cached packs are not supported during local GC as the bitmap rebuild
logic does not support including a cached pack in the result.

Strip out the validation and force PackWriter to always disable the
cached pack feature if reuseValidation is enabled.

A larger than expected number of real-world repositories found on
the Interent contain invalid author, committer and tagger lines
in their history. Many of these seem to be caused by users misuing
the user.name and user.email fields, e.g.:

  [user]
    name = Au Thor <author@example.com>
	email = author@example.com

that some version of Git (or a reimplementation thereof) copied
directly into the object header. These headers are not valid and
are rejected by a strict fsck, making it impossible to transfer
the repository with JGit/EGit.

Allow callers and users to weaken the fsck settings to accept these
sorts of breakages if they really want to work on a repo that has
broken history.  Most routines will still function fine, however
commit timestamp sorting in RevWalk may become confused by a corrupt
committer line and sort commits out of order.

Since git-core ff5effd (v1.7.12.1) the native wire protocol transmits
the server and client implementation and version strings using
capability ""agent=git/1.7.12.1"" or similar.

Support this in JGit and hang the implementation data off UploadPack
and ReceivePack.  On HTTP transports default to the User-Agent HTTP
header until the client overrides this with the optional capability
string in the first line.

Extract the user agent string into a UserAgent class under transport
where it can be specified to a different value if the application's
build process has broken the Implementation-Version header in the
JGit package.

I couldn't create a test case leading to this situation but I have seen
such situations while inspecting Bug: 465393. It seems that such

Previously using an ObjectWalk meant uninteresting commits may keep
their commit message buffers in memory just in case they were found to
be on the boundary and were output as UNINTERESTING for the caller.

This was incorrect inside StartGenerator. ObjectWalk hides these
internal UNINTERESTING cases from its caller unless RevSort.BOUNDARY
was explicitly set, and its false by default. Callers never see an
one of these saved uninteresting commits.

Change the test to allow early dispose unless the application has
explicitly asked for RevSort.BOUNDARY. This allows uninteresting
commit buffers to be discarded and garbage collected in ObjectWalks
when the caller will never be given the RevCommit.

Document the default for RevWalk is setRetainBody(true), where the

Change the default for Objectwalk to setRetainBody(false), as nearly
all callers want only the graph shape and do not need the larger text

Avoid always calling `sh -c umask` on startup, instead deferring
the invocation until the first time a working tree file needs to
use the execute bit. This allows servers using bare repos to avoid
a costly fork+exec for a value that is never used.

Store the umask as an int instead of two Boolean. This is slightly
smaller memory (one int vs. two references) and makes it easier for
an application to force setting the umask to a value that overrides
whatever the shell told JGit.

Simplify the code to bail by returning early when canExecute is
false, which is the common case for working tree files.

When during a PushOperation the server hits an exception different from
UnpackException the JGit server behaved wrong. That kind of exceptions
are handled so late that the connection is already released and the
information whether to talk sideband to the client is lost. In detail:
ReceivePack.receive() will call release() and that will reset the
capabilities. But later on the stack in ReceivePackServlet.doPost() it
is tried to send a response to client now with reset capabilities (no
sideband!).

If the thread reading a pack file is interrupted don't invalidate that
pack file.

This could happen when Gerrit invoked JGit for computing a diff in one
thread and waited for the call to finish from another thread, with a
timeout. When the timeout was reached the ""diff"" thread was interrupted.
If it happened to be in an IO operation, reading a pack file, an
InterruptedIOException was thrown and the pack file was marked as
invalid and removed from the pack list.

Invalidating the pack in that case could cause the project disappearing in
Gerrit as discussed in [1] and [2].

discoverGitSystemConfig() fails. Fix that by introducing a member variable
that caches the result of discoverGitSystemConfig() as well as a setter
method to overwrite the content of that variable.

The SimilarityIndex class implements the useful capability of scoring
the similarity between two files. That capability is required for a
feature that's being developed in another package, to detect files
derived from a set of potential sources.

This CL adds a public factory method to create a SimilarityIndex from
an ObjectLoader. It grants public access to the SimilarityIndex class,
the score method, an inner exception class and a special marker
instance of that exception class.

The primary goal is to improve exception readability. Since this is a
standalone thread, just logging the stack trace of the caught
exception is not very useful:

java.io.IOException: Stream closed
	at java.io.BufferedInputStream.getBufIfOpen(BufferedInputStream.java:162)
	at java.io.BufferedInputStream.read(BufferedInputStream.java:258)
	at org.eclipse.jgit.util.FS$2.run(FS.java:451)

Providing a named class eliminates the ""FS$2"", and including the
command name provides a little more context in the error message.
A future improvement might include the stack trace that created the
GobblerThread as well.

Whether the output stream specified with setOutputStream() is closed by
ArchiveCommand.call() is murky and inconsistent:

- on success, it is closed
- if an exception is encountered when writing the archive, it is closed
- if an exception is encountered when calling createArchiveStream to
  open the archive, we forget to close it

Close the output stream consistently to avoid leaks.

Now that the inner try-with-resources doesn't have its own finally
block, this allows us to merge the two try blocks.

It would be even better to never close the output stream.  That will
involve more API changes to avoid silently breaking callers, so it is
deferred to a later change.

Early JGit code used comments to inform the Eclipse formatter about
where to break lines and used final in the hope of making code faster.
The ArchiveCommand command implementation imitated that style.

Nowadays the project relies less on the Eclipse formatter and relies
more on Java having sane performance with local variables that are not
explicitly marked 'final'.  Removing the unnecessary empty comments and
'final' qualifiers makes this code more readable and more consistent
with recent JGit code.

This exception's detail message states

	Service not permitted

and according to the Javadoc it indicates that the current user does not
have access to the service.  In practice, though, callers handle this
exception by presenting a '401 Unauthorized' response to the client,
meaning that the user is unauthenticated and should authenticate.

Clarify the documentation and detail message to match the practice.

The exception message is not used anywhere except logs.  No
client-visible effect intended.

When sending an error response due to ServiceNotAuthorizedException or
ServiceNotEnabledException, usually we send a default message.  In the
ServiceNotEnabledException case, we use

	403 Git access forbidden

except in a dumb-HTTP-specific filter where we use the servlet
container's default 403 response:

	403 Forbidden

In the ServiceNotAuthorizedException case, we use the servlet
container's default 401 response:

	401 Unauthorized

There is one exception: a ServiceNotEnabledException when handling a
smart HTTP /info/refs request uses the message from the exception:

	403 Service not enabled

Be more consistent by always using the message from the exception.  This
way, authors of a RepositoryResolver, UploadPackFactory, or
ReceivePackFactory can provide a more detailed message when appropriate.
The defaults are

	401 Unauthorized
	403 Service not enabled

Make JGit make the same distinction. This is in line with the current
Javadoc of getString, which claims to return ""a String value from the
config, null if not found"". It is more reasonable to interpret ""x =""
in the above example as ""found"" rather than ""missing"".

We need to maintain the special handling of a key name with no ""=""
resolving to a boolean true, but ""="" with an empty string is still not
a valid boolean.

exactRef(ref1, ref2, ref3) requests multiple specific refs in a single
lookup, which may be faster in some backends than looking them up one by
one.

firstExactRef generalizes getRef by finding the first existing ref from
the list of refs named.  Its main purpose is for the default
implementation of getRef (finding the first existing ref in a search
path).  Hopefully it can be useful for other operations that look for
refs in a search path (e.g., git log --notes=<name>), too.

C git 2.5 supports setting the equivalent of
RequestPolicy.REACHABLE_COMMIT with uploadpack.allowreachablesha1inwant.
Parse this into TransportConfig and use it from UploadPack. An explicitly
set RequestPolicy overrides the config, and the policy may still be
upgraded on a unidirectional connection to avoid races.

This reverts commit 96eb3ee3976e7e9e3e118851fa614cce8a1f7d88, which
broke Gerrit tests that set a config value to 'null', serialize the
result, deserialize, and expect 'null' from Config.getString.

The intent of that commit was to make it possible to distinguish between
an absent and an empty config value, which we'll have to do with a new
method.

The code part of this commit is a straightforward revert.  Keep the
tests from 428cb23f2de8 instead of reverting them --- they illustrate
the behavior well.

C git's receive-pack.c strips trailing newlines in command lists when
present[1], although send-pack.c does not send them[2]. Change JGit to
match this behavior. Add tests.

This also fixes parsing of commands in the push cert, which, unlike
commands sent in the non-push case, always have trailing newlines.

- Consistently return structured data, such as actual ReceiveCommands,
  which is more useful for callers that are doing things other than
  verifying the signature, e.g. recording the set of commands.
- Store the certificate version field, as this is required to be part
  of the signed payload.
- Add a toText() method to recreate the actual payload for signature
  verification.
- Separate the parser from the certificate itself, so the actual
  PushCertificate object can be immutable. Make a fair attempt at deep
  immutability, but this is not possible with the current mutable
  ReceiveCommand structure.
- Use more detailed error messages that don't involve NON-NLS strings.
- Document null return values more thoroughly. Instead of having the
  undocumented behavior of throwing NPE from certain methods if they
  are not first guarded by enabled(), eliminate enabled() and return
  null from those methods.
- Add tests for parsing a push cert from a section of pkt-line stream
  using a real live stream captured with Wireshark (which, it should
  be noted, uncovered several simply incorrect statements in C git's
  Documentation/technical/pack-protocol.txt).

Most relative-URL tests for SubmoduleInitCommand carry out the following
steps:

 1. add a submodule at path ""sub"" to the index
 2. set remote.origin.url in .git/config
 3. configure .gitmodules, possibly using relative URLs, and see what
    happens

resolveWorkingDirectoryRelativeUrl() is meant to test the fallback when
remote.origin.url is not set, to match C git which treats the URL as
relative to the cwd in that case.  To do so, in step (2) it sets
remote.origin.url to null.

However, Config.setString when taking a null value does not actually
unset that value from the configuration --- it sets it to the empty
string.  This means we are testing a behavior that C git never
supported.  Use Config.unset instead.

In a bare repository, a null remote name is accepted by mistake,
producing a configuration with items like 'remote.url' instead of
'remote.<remote>.url'.  This was never meant to work --- forbid it.

This method is documented to take a branch name (not a possibly null
string).  The only way a caller could have set null without either
re-setting to a sane value afterward or producing NullPointerException
was to also call setNoCheckout(true), in which case there would have
been no reason to set the branch in the first place.

Forbid null to make the semantics clear.

PostUploadHook/PostUploadHookChain to replace
UploadPackLogger/UploadPackLoggerChain and deprecates the latter.

It also introduces PackStatistics as a replacement for
PackWriter.Statistics, since the latter is not public API.
It changes PackWriter to use PackStatistics and reimplements
PackWriter.Statistics to delegate to PackStatistics.

These differ subtly from a PersonIdent, because they can contain
anything that is a valid User ID passed to gpg --local-user. Upstream
git push --signed will just take the configuration value from
user.signingkey and pass that verbatim in both --local-user and the
pusher field of the certificate. This does not necessarily contain an
email address, which means the parsing implementation ends up being
substantially different from RawParseUtils.parsePersonIdent.
Nonetheless, we try hard to match PersonIdent behavior in
questionable cases.

a85e817d is a slightly breaking API change to classes that were
technically public and technically released in 4.0. However, it is
highly unlikely that people were actually depending on public behavior,
since there were no public methods to create PushCertificates with
anything other than null field values, or a PushCertificateParser that
did anything other than infinite loop or throw exceptions when reading.

The invalidId message in JGitText and the asAscii bad id both contain a

Fix it by keeping the colon in the translated message and not adding
another colon programmatically.

Discussion on the git mailing list has concluded[1] that the intended
behavior for all (non-sideband) portions of the receive-pack protocol
is for trailing LFs in pkt-lines to be optional. Go back to using
PacketLineIn#readString() everywhere.

For push certificates specifically, we agreed that the payload signed
by the client is always concatenated with LFs even though the client
MAY omit LFs when framing the certificate for the wire. This is still
reflected in the implementation of PushCertificate#toText().

There is a signature of the test helper method `indexState`,
in `RepositoryTestCase`, that accepts a `Repository` object
as an argument.  However, there was one line of code where
this variable was not being used, and the method was instead
referring to a member variable `db`.  I believe this was
probably just an oversight in a previous refactor, and
that the correct behavior is to use the variable from
the argument list.  This change also has the benefit
of making it possible to convert this method to a static
method, since it no longer relies on any state from the class.

The test helper method `indexState` in `RepositoryTestCase` is
very useful for writing tests, even in cases where we need to
do things like create more than one repository for a test and
thus we don't want to use the built-in `db` member variable that
exists in `RepositoryTestCase`.  Since the method is static,
we can move it up to the parent class `LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase`,
where it can be used by tests that aren't a great fit for inheriting
directly from `RepositoryTestCase`.

Rather than lazily parsing the push in this method, parse it at the
end of recvCommands(), which already contains the necessary try/catch
for handling this error. This allows later callers to avoid having to

Simple servlet supporting file content storage for ""Large File Storage""

- upload and download of large files is probably network bound hence use
  asynchronous servlet for good scalability
- simple object storage in file system with 2 level fan-out
- storage interface LargeObjectRepository allows alternate storage
  implementations
- use LockFile to protect writing large objects against multiple
  concurrent uploads of the same object
- to prevent corrupt uploads the uploaded file is rejected if its hash
  doesn't match id given in URL

The meta data API defined in [2] which is used to discover the URLs of
large objects stored by the LFS server will be implemented in another

Once bitmap creation begins the internal maps required for packing are
no longer necessary.  On a repository with 5.2M objects this can save
more than 438 MiB of memory by allowing the ObjectToPack instances to
get garbage collected away.

Downside is the PackWriter cannot be used for any further opertions
except to write the bitmap index.  This is an acceptable trade-off as
in practice nobody uses the PackWriter after the bitmaps are built.

For construction performance each new EWAHBitmap is allocated at the
roughly worst-case size the bitmap would need if all of the words must
be literal and no run length compression is available.  In practice
this is far larger than is required, wasting heap memory while the
bitmaps are computed.

Trim down each bitmap to its minimum required size. This copies the
internal array to a new smaller array, allowing the GC to reclaim the
prior larger array for reuse.

A single bitmap of 5.2M bits is only 79 KiB of memory without this

DfsGarbageCollector asks PackWriter for the set of objects packed
after the bitmap index is written out.  This is now null as it was
cleared to release memory. Instead use PackBitmapIndexBuilder to
build the set as it also has the objects.

Reduce memory in PackBitmapIndexBuilder by fully discarding the
ObjectToPack instances. This was the original intent of commit
4bb523475d44 (""PackWriter: shed memory while creating bitmaps"")
but failed as the instances were still held live here.

Switch to BlockList instead of ObjectToPack[]. This allows the
JVM to allocate many smaller arrays instead of one contiguous
array with 5.2M reference pointers. In a tight heap the smaller
allocations are more feasible.

Reduce the initial EWAHCompressedBitmaps for the 4 type maps.  On
average a typical repository is 30% commits, 30% trees and 30% blobs.
These bitmaps are typically very dense.  PackWriter orders objects by
commit, tree, blob when writing the file so these should always be a
very dense run of 1s with some 0s before and after. So even the 1/3rd
allocation is likely too large, but the later trim() will reduce the
internal buffer anyway.

When setting timeout on push, BasePackConnection creates a timer, which
will be terminated when push finishes. But, when using
SmartHttpPushConnection, it drops the first timer created in the
constructor and then creates another timer in doPush. If new threads are
created faster than the gc collects them this may stop the service if
it's hitting the max process limit. Hence terminate the timer if it
existed before BasePackConnection.init() creates a new timer.

TODO: this works so far only if the new non-empty directory has no files
added to the index. If there are such files, they are currently added to

to check which files can be safely deleted and which shouldn't.

A stale file handle exception will be raised on NFS servers if the
packed-refs file is replaced by another client while the current one is
reading the old one.  On a local filesystem, the old orphaned file will
just be read.  But files cannot be orphaned on NFS servers (since NFS
servers do no keep track of open files), so the replacement will cause
the old file to be garbage collected instead, and reads will fail with
stale file handle exceptions.  Since we no longer have access to the old
file, loop on stale file handle exceptions trying to read the
packed-refs file again, until we either read the new file, or find that
the file no longer exists.

It was reported in [1] that 197e3393a51424fae45e51dce4a649ba26e5a368 led
to a performance regression in a BFG benchmark. Analysis showed that
this is caused by the exists() method in FS_POSIX, now overriding the
default implementation in FS. The default implementation of FS.exists()
uses java.io.File.exists(), while the new implementation in FS_POSIX
uses java.nio.file.Files.exists() - by simply removing the override in
FS_POSIX, performance was restored.

Profiling showed that java.nio.file.Files.exists() is substantially
slower than java.io.File.exists(), to the point where the exists() call
doubles the average cost of a call to
ObjectDirectory.insertUnpackedObject() - which the BFG uses a lot,
because it's rewriting history. Average times measured on Ubuntu were:

java.io.File.exists() - 4 microseconds
java.nio.file.Files.exists() - 60 microseconds

The loose object exists test should be using java.io.File and not FS.
ObjectDirectory uses FS.resolve() to traverse symlinks to objects but
then once inside objects all 256 sharded directories should be real
directories, and the object files should be real files, not dangling
symlinks. java.io.File.exists() is sufficient here, and faster.

Change ObjectDirectory to use File.exists() once its computed the File
handle.

This does mean JGit cannot run ObjectDirectory code on an abstract
virtual filesystem plugged into NIO2. If you really want to run JGit on
an esoteric non-standard filesystem like ""in memory"" you should look at
the DFS storage backend, which has fewer abstraction points to deal
with. Or write your own from scratch.

Repository has a usage counter that is initialized to 1 at
instantiation and this counter is decremented when Repository.close
method is called. There is also a Repository.incrementOpen method that
RepositoryCache uses to increment the usage count when it's returning a
repository that is already opened.

The problem was that RepositoryCache was incrementing the usage count
for repositories that it just opened. The usage count was 2 when it
should have been 1.

Incrementing usage count is now only be done for repository that are
served from the cache.

This bug is causing slow memory increase of our Gerrit server until the
server become slow. Even if the RepositoryCache is using SoftReference,
it seems that the JVM is not garbage collecting the repositories because
it's not yet on the edge of being out of memory.

To test this change, I replicated all repositories(11k) from Gerrit
master to one slave. The Gerrit master used memory after this test was
10GB without this change and 3.5GB with.

When repositories are opened using the RepositoryCache, they are kept in
memory and when the repository usage counter reaches 0, the
Repository.close method is called which then calls close method on its
reference and object databases.

The problem is that RefDirectory.close method was a no-op and the
reference database was kept in memory. This problem is only happening
when opening a repository using the RepositoryCache because it never
evicts repositories, it's just calling the close method.

If a client mistakenly tries to send a tag object as a shallow line
JGit blindly assumes this is a commit and tries to parse the tag
buffer using the commit parser. This can cause an obtuse error like:

  InvalidObjectIdException: Invalid id: t c0ff331234...

The ""t"" comes from the ""object c0ff331234..."" line of the tag tring
to be parsed as though it where the ""tree"" line of a commit.

Run any client supplied shallow lines through the RevWalk to lookup
the object types. Fail fast with a protocol exception if any of them
are non-commit.

Skip objects not known to this repository. This matches behavior
with git-core's upload-pack, which sliently skips over any shallow
line object named by the client but not known by the server.

The current way of processing submodules results in no hunk header and
includes the contents of the hunk as part of the headers. To fix this, we
can't just have our writeGitLinkDiffText output the hunk header. We have
to change the flow so that the raw text gets parsed as a diff. The easiest
way to do this is to fake the RawText in the FormatResult when we have a
GITLINK.

It should be noted that it seems possible for there to be a difference
between a GITLINK and a non-GITLINK, but I don't think this can happen in
practice, so I don't think we need to worry too much about it.

This patch also fixes up the test for GitLink headers, as the test was
for the old behavior. My setup has 3 other failing tests which may or
may not be the result of environmental changes. However, the same tests
fail without this commit, so I do not believe they are related.

RepositoryCache has 2 methods to remove a repository from the cache but
they are never called when a repository is closed. Users of the cache
were expected to call one of those 2 methods but how could they have
called them at proper time without having visibility of the repository
usage count.

Ideally, I would have rework the RepositoryCache to wrap any repository
it opens in a class that would be responsible to unregister them from the
cache when it's really closed, i.e. when usage counter reaches 0. The
problem preventing the wrapping solution is the RepositoryCache.register
method that allows to register an already opened repository in the cache.
Such repositories cannot be wrapped because caller are still holding a
reference on the unwrapped repository.

Document that RepositoryCache.close method is removing the repository
from the cache as well as closing it and rework
RepositoryCache.unregister method to only remove the repository from the
cache. Use the latter to unregister repository when Repository.doClose
is getting executed.

A bitmap index contains bitmaps for a set of commits in a pack file.
Creating a bitmap for every commit is too expensive, so heuristics
select the most ""important"" commits. The most recent commits are the
most valuable. To clone a repository only those for the branch tips are
needed. When fetching, only commits since the last fetch are needed.

The commit selection heuristics generally work, but for some
repositories the number of selected commits is prohibitively high. One
example is the MSM 3.10 Linux kernel. With over 1 million commits on
2820 branches, the current heuristics resulted in +36k selected commits.
Each uncompressed bitmap for that repository is ~413k, making it
difficult to complete a GC operation in available memory.

The benefit of creating bitmaps over the entire history of a repository
like the MSM 3.10 Linux kernel isn't clear. For that repository, most
history for the last year appears to be in the last 100k commits.
Limiting bitmap commit selection to just those commits reduces the count
of selected commits from ~36k to ~10.5k. Dropping bitmaps for older
commits does not affect object counting times for clones or for fetches
on clients that are reasonably up-to-date.

This patch defines a new ""bitmapCommitRange"" PackConfig parameter to
limit the commit selection process when building bitmaps. The range
starts with the most recent commit and walks backwards. A range of 10k
considers only the 10000 most recent commits. A range of zero creates
bitmaps only for branch tips. A range of -1 (the default) does not limit
the range--all commits in the pack are used in the commit selection
process.

CommitCommand should allow to specify whether empty commits (commits
having the same tree as the sole predecessor commit) are allowed or not.
Similar to native git's ""--allow-empty"" flag. 

The defaults differ between JGit and native git even after this change.
When not specifying paths then by default JGit allows to create empty
commits while native git does not. It would be API breaking to changes
this now.

Replace the “bitmapCommitRange” knob that was recently introduced with
two new knobs: “bitmapExcessiveBranchCount” and
“bitmapInactiveBranchAgeInDays”. If the count of branches does not
exceed “bitmapExcessiveBranchCount”, then the current algorithm is kept
for all branches.

If the branch count is excessive, then the commit time for the tip
commit for each branch is used to determine if a branch is “inactive”.
""Active"" branches get full commit selection using the existing
algorithm. ""Inactive"" branches get fewer bitmaps near the branch tips.

Expose all of the bitmap selection parameters via PackConfig:
""bitmapContiguousCommitCount"", ""bitmapRecentCommitCount"",
""bitmapRecentCommitSpan"", ""bitmapDistantCommitSpan"",
""bitmapExcessiveBranchCount"", and ""bitmapInactiveBranchAge"".

Add an optimization to break out of the inner loop of selectCommits() if
all of the commits for the current branch have already been found.

When reusing bitmaps from an existing packs, remove unnecessary
populating and clearing of the writeBitmaps/PackBitmapIndexBuilder.

Add comments to PackWriterBitmapPreparer, rename methods and variables
for readability.

Add tests.

Expose the following bitmap selection parameters via PackConfig:
""bitmapContiguousCommitCount"", ""bitmapRecentCommitCount"",
""bitmapRecentCommitSpan"", ""bitmapDistantCommitSpan"",
""bitmapExcessiveBranchCount"", and ""bitmapInactiveBranchAge"".

The value of bitmapContiguousCommitCount, whereby bitmaps are
created for the most recent N commits in a branch, has never
been verified. If experiments show that they are not valuable,
then we can simplify the implementation so that there is only
a concept of recent and distant commit history (defined by
""bitmapRecentCommitCount""), and the only controls we need are
""bitmapRecentCommitSpan"" and ""bitmapDistantCommitSpan"".

Prior to this change, DfsInserter would not insert an object into a pack
if it already existed in another pack in the repository, even if that
pack was unreachable. Consider this sequence of events:

- Object FOO is pushed to a repository.
- Subsequent ref changes make FOO UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE.
- FOO is subsequently re-inserted using a DfsInserter, but skipped
  due to existing in UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE.
- The repository is repacked; FOO will not be written into a new pack
  because it is not yet reachable from a reference. If the
  UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE packs are deleted, FOO disappears.
- A reference is updated to reference FOO. This reference is now broken
  as FOO was removed when the repacking process deleted the
  UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE pack that stored the only copy of FOO.

The garbage collector can't safely delete the UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE
pack because FOO might be in the middle of being re-inserted/re-packed.

This change writes a duplicate copy of an object if it only exists in
UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE. This ""freshens"" the object to give it a chance to
survive long enough to be made reachable through a reference.

Searching for deltas in an existing pack is O(N^2). The delta search is
partitioned into tasks, and each task contains one or more slices of work to be
performed. Once each DeltaTask works through its initial (small) set of
assigned work it attempts to ""steal"" additional work by searching for the
largest remaining slice via a linear search. So if N is the number of tasks and
K is average number of slices per task, then the number of comparisons performed
finding largest remaining slices is K*N * N.

I don't understand the delta compression algorithm well enough to know whether
choosing the longest remaining task is always required (the current algorithm
strongly suggests it is), or if there might be a better way to assign initial
work so that less ""stealing"" is required. The change here is modest and based
on the following understanding: tasks are set up prior to execution, and once a
task is completed no new work is added to it. So once a task is seen as
completed, it can be excluded from future searches. DeltaTask.Block.stealWork()
is already synchronized. This patch removes completed tasks from the
DeltaTask.Block.tasks member variable in that synchronized block. On the MSM
3.10 Linux kernel repository, this was seen to decrease the time in the
PackWriter.parallelDeltaSearch() method from (1615+1633+1458)/3 = 1568 seconds
to (465+479+477)/3 = 473 seconds.

When garbage collecting, we decide to reuse some bitmaps in older
history from the previous pack to save time.  The remainder of commit
selection only involves commits not covered by those bitmaps.

Currently we carry that out in two ways:

1. by building a bitmap representing the already-covered commits,
   for easy containment checks and AND-NOT-ing against
2. by marking the reused bitmap commits as uninteresting in the
   RevWalk that finds new commits

The mechanism in (2) is less efficient than (1): rw.next() will walk
back from reused bitmap commits to check whether the commit it is
about to emit is an ancestor of them, when using the bitmap from (1)
would let us perform the same check with a single contains() call.
Add a RevFilter teaching the RevWalk to perform that same check
directly using the bitmap from (1)

The next time the RevWalk is used, a different RevFilter is installed
so this does not break that.

A later commit will drop the markUninteresting calls.

No functional change intended except a possible speedup.

Until 320a4142 (Update bitmap selection throttling to fully span
active branches, 2015-10-20), setupTipCommitBitmaps contained code
along the following lines:

	for (PackBitmapIndexRemapper.Entry entry : bitmapRemapper) {
		if (!reuse(entry))
			continue;
		RevCommit rc = (RevCommit) rw.peel(rw.parseAny(entry));

		reuseCommits.add(new BitmapCommit(rc));
		EWAHCompressedBitmap bitmap =
			remap.ofObjectType(remap.getBitmap(rc), OBJ_COMMIT);
		writeBitmaps.addBitmap(rc, bitmap, 0);
		reuse.add(rc, OBJ_COMMIT);
	}
	writeBitmaps.clearBitmaps();	// Remove temporary bitmaps

This loop OR-ed together bitmaps for commits whose bitmaps would be
reused.  A subtle point is the use of the add() method, which ORs in a
bitmap from the BitmapIndex when it exists and falls back to OR-ing in
a single bit when that bitmap does not exist in the BitmapIndex.

Commit 320a4142 removed the addBitmap step, so the bitmap does not
exist in the BitmapIndex and the fallback behavior is triggered.

Simplify and restore the intended behavior by avoiding use of the
subtle use of the add() method --- use or() directly instead.

The BitmapIndex.BitmapBuilder.add API is subtle:

	/**
	 * Adds the id and the existing bitmap for the id, if one
	 * exists, to the bitmap.
	 *
	 * @return true if the value was not contained or able to be
	 * loaded.
	 */
	boolean add(AnyObjectId objectId, int type);

Reading the name of the method does not make it obvious what it will
do.  Does it add the named object to the bitmap, or all objects
reachable from it?  It depends on whether the BitmapIndex owns an
existing bitmap for that object.  I did not notice this subtlety when
skimming the javadoc, either.  This resulted in enough confusion to
subtly break the bitmap building code (see change
I30844134bfde0cbabdfaab884c84b9809dd8bdb8 for details).

So discourage use of the add() API by deprecating it.

To replace it, provide a set() method that sets a single bit.  This
way, callers can decide whether to use set() or or() based on the
context.

For example,

	if (bitmap.add(c)) {
		for (RevCommit p : c.getParents()) {
			rememberToAlsoHandle(p);
		}
	}

can be replaced with

	if (bitmap.contains(c)) {
		// already included
	} else if (index.getBitmap(c) != null) {
		bitmap.or(index.getBitmap(c));
	} else {
		bitmap.set(c, OBJ_COMMIT);
		for (RevCommit p : c.getParents()) {
			rememberToAlsoHandle(p);
		}
	}

which is more verbose but makes it clearer that the behavior
depends on the content of index.getBitmaps().

When creating bitmaps during gc, the bitmaps in tipCommitBitmaps are
built in setupTipCommitBitmaps using the following procedure:

 0. create a bitmap ('reuse') that lists all ancestors of commits
    whose existing bitmaps will be reused.  I will call this the
    reused part of history.

 1. initialize a bitmap for each of the pack's ""want""s by taking
    a copy of the 'reuse' bitmap and setting the bit corresponding
    to the one wanted commit.

 2. walk through ancestors of wants, excluding the reused part of
    history.  Add parents of visited commits to bitmaps that have
    those commits.

 3. AND-NOT each tipCommitBitmap against the 'reuse' bitmap

 4. Sort the bitmaps and AND-NOT each against the previous so they
    partition the new commits.

The OR against 'reuse' in step 1 and the AND-NOT against 'reuse'
cancel each other out, except when commits from the reused part of
history are added to a bitmap in step 2.  So avoid adding commits from
the reused part of history in step 2 and skip the OR and AND-NOT.

DO NOT SUBMIT unless this is measured to be faster.

A CompressedBitmap represents a pair (EWAH bit vector, PackIndex
assigning bit positions to git objects).  The bit vector is a member
field and the PackIndex is implicit via the 'this' reference to the
outer class.

Make this clearer by making CompressedBitmap a static class and
replacing the 'this' reference an explicit field.

Likewise for CompressedBitmapBuilder.

Commit 847b3d1 enabled annotation-based NPE analysis to JGit.

In so doing, it introduced a new dependency on the org.eclipse.jdt that
is undesirable. Follow Gerrit's lead by adding an internal Nullable type
(see
https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.11/gerrit-common/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/common/Nullable.java). 

The javax.annotations.Nullable class uses a retention policy of RUNTIME,
whereas the org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.Nullable class used a policy of
CLASS. Since I'm not aware of tools that make use of the annotation at
runtime I chose the CLASS policy. If in the future there is a benefit to
retaining the annotations in the running binary we can update this
class.

Update the project-specific Eclipse settings to replace the use of the
org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.Nullable class the new JGit-specific
@Nullable annotation. I verified that Eclipse reports errors when the
return value of a method annotated with
@org.eclipse.jgit.annotations.Nullable is dereferenced without a null
check.

Also remove the Maven and MANIFEST.MF dependencies on
org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.

Eclipse null analysis uses three annotations: @Nullable, @NonNull and
@NonNullByDefault. All three are updated in this patch because it is
invalid to set the Eclipse preferences to empty values. So far only
@Nullable has been introduced in org.eclipse.jgit.annotations.

My personal preference is to follow the advice in Effective Java and
avoid the null-return idiom, and to avoid passing null values in
general. This sets the expectation is that arguments and return types
are assumed non-null unless otherwise documented. If that is the
expectation, then consistent application of @NonNull is redundant and
hurts readability by cluttering the code, obscuring the occasional
@Nullable annotation that really requires attention.

If the JGit community decides there is value in using the @NonNull and
@NonNullByDefault annotations we can add them--this change configures
Eclipse to use them.

When asked to read a symref pointing to a branch-yet-to-be-born (such
as HEAD in a newly initialized repository), DfsRepository and
FileRepository return different results.

FileRepository:

	exactRef(""HEAD"") => null

DfsRepository:

	exactRef(""HEAD"") => SymbolicRef[HEAD -> refs/heads/master=00000000]

getRef(""HEAD"") returns the same as DfsRepository's exactRef in both
backends.

The intended behavior is the DfsRepository one: exactRef() is supposed
to be like getRef(), but more exact because it doesn't need to
traverse the search path.

The discrepancy is because DfsRefDatabase implements exactRef()
directly with the intended semantics, while RefDirectory uses a
fallback implementation built on top of getRefs().  getRefs() skips
symrefs to an unborn branch.

Let the fallback implementation use getRef instead to avoid this.
This means that exactRef will waste some effort traversing the ref
search path when the named ref is not found --- optimizing it to avoid
that traversal will happen in a followup change.

getRef() loops over its search path to find a ref:

	Ref ref = null;
	for (String prefix : SEARCH_PATH) {
		ref = readRef(prefix + needle, packed);
		if (ref != null) {
			ref = resolve(ref, 0, null, null, packed);
			break;
		}
	}
	fireRefsChanged();
	return ref;

If readRef returns null (indicating that the ref does not exist), the
loop continues so we can find the ref later in the search path.  And
resolve should never return null, so if we return null it should mean
we exhausted the entire search path and didn't find the ref.

... except that resolve can return null: it does so when it has
followed too many symrefs and concluded that there is a symref loop:

	if (MAX_SYMBOLIC_REF_DEPTH <= depth)
		return null; // claim it doesn't exist

Continue the loop instead of returning null immediately.  This makes
the behavior more consistent.

Arguably getRef should throw an exception when a symref loop is
detected.  That would be a more invasive change, so if it's a good
idea it will have to wait for another patch.

different results.

	getRef: SymbolicRef[HEAD -> refs/heads/master=00000000]
	getRefs and getAdditionalRefs: nothing

exactRef should match the getRef behavior: it is meant to be a
simpler, faster version of getRef that lets you search for a ref
without resolving it using the search path without other semantic
changes.  But the fallback implementation of exactRef relis on getRefs
and produces null for this case.

Luckily the in-tree RefDatabase implementations override exactRef and
get the correct behavior.  But any out-of-tree storage backend that
doesn't inherit from DfsRefDatabase or RefDirectory would still return
null when it shouldn't.

Let the fallback implementation use getRef instead to avoid this.
This means that exactRef would waste some effort traversing the ref
search path when the named ref is not found --- but subclasses tend to
override exactRef for performance already, so in the default
implementation correctness is more important.

When JGit tries to detect symlink support the attempt to create a
symlink may fail with a java.lang.InternalError. This was reported for a
case where the application using JGit runs in Windows XP compatibility
mode using Oracle JDK 1.8. Handle this by assuming symlinks are not
supported in this case.

org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Repository class is an example of the API which
should be written with Java 8 java.util.Optional<T> type. Unfortunately
this API is already released and widely used. The good clients are
currently doing their best with checking return values for null and bad
clients do not know how bad their code is.

I've tried not to change any logic and to be as less intrusive as
possible. Most of the JGit code was well prepared to this, only few
classes needed some smaller fixes. That's not the case for EGit - we
will have 110 compiler errors there after this change, a huge patch
follows later.

This change fixes all compiler errors in JGit and replaces possible
NPE's with either appropriate exceptions, avoiding multiple ""Nullable
return"" method calls or early returning from the method.

Other plugins which want to use JGit nulness annotations in their code
cannot do this if the annotations aren't part of the published API.

Unfortunately it looks like although Eclipse JDT allows to use custom
nullness annotation types per project, it does not understand if those
annotations are used mixed with other nullness annotations in other
projects. E.g. EGit can either configure JGit annotations for NPE
analysis and so ""understand"" nullness from JGit API but so it looses the
ability to use any other nullness annotations to annotate its own code.

Recursively copying a tree into a DirCache is a bottleneck for some
algorithms like the in memory merge code in Gerrit Code Review.  Drop
a layer down in the stack and use CanonicalTreeParser directly as the
addition logic only processes 1 tree at a time and does not need the
merge sorting feature (or overhead) of TreeWalk.

Combined with 761814fe9c (""DirCacheEntry: Speed up creation by
avoiding string cast"") tree loading nearly halves in running time
from 70ms to 36ms on some platforms.

Instead of checking every entry for .gitattributes only look for the
entry on request by TreeWalk.  This avoids impacting uses like RevWalk
filtering history.

When the attrs is requested skip to the start of the tree and look for
.gitattributes until either it is found, or it is impossible to be
present.  Due to the sorting rules of tree entries "".gitattributes""
should be among the first or second entries in the tree so very few
entries will need to be considered.

Waiting to find the .gitattributes file by native ordering may miss
attrs for files like "".config"", which sorts before "".gitattributes"".
Starting from the front of the tree on demand ensures the attributes
are parsed as early as necessary to process any entry in the tree.

Today there are plenty of modern build tool systems available in the

* http://bazel.io
* https://pantsbuild.github.io
* http://shakebuild.com
* https://ninja-build.org
* https://buckbuild.com

The attributes, that all these build tools have in common, are:

* reliable
* correct
* very fast
* reproducible

It must not always be the other build tool, this project is currently
using. Or, quoting Gerrit Code Review maintainer here:

  ""Friends, don't let friends use <the other build tool system>!""

This change is non-complete implementation of JGit build in Buck,
needed by Gerrit Code Review to replace its dependency with standlone
JGit cell. This is very useful when a developer is working on both
projects and is trying to integrate changes made in JGit in Gerrit.

The supported workflow is:

  $ cd jgit
  $ emacs <hack>
  $ cd ../gerrit
  $ buck build --config repositories.jgit=../jgit gerrit

With --config repositories.jgit=../jgit jgit cell is routed through
JGit development tree.

To build jgit, issue:

  $ buck build //:jgit
  [-] PROCESSING BUCK FILES...FINISHED 0,0s

Yes, you can't measure no-op build time, given that Buck daemon is
used.

Pushing with JGit commandline to e.g. Github failed with ""unauthorized""
since HttpUrlConnection calls the configured authenticator implicitly.

The problem is that during a push two requests are sent to the server,
first a GET and then a POST (containing the pack data). The first GET
request sent anonymously is rejected with 401 (unauthorized). When an
Authenticator is installed the java.net classes will use the
Authenticator to ask the user for credentials and retry the request.
But this happens under the hood and JGit level code doesn't see that
this happens.

The next request is the POST but since JGit thinks the first GET request
went through anonymously it doesn't add authentication headers to the
POST request. This POST of course also fails with 401 but since this
request contains a lot of body-data streamed from JGit (the pack file!)
the java.net classes can't simply retry the request with authorization
headers. The whole process fails.

Fix this by using Apache httpclient which doesn't use Authenticator to
retrieve credentials. Instead initialize TransportCommand to use the
default credential provider if no other credentials provider was set
explicitly. org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Main sets this default for the JGit
command line client.

JGit's Nullable type was added[1] in the hope of being able to add
nullness annotations that (a) do not preclude building and running
with Java 7 and (b) could be shared by Gerrit, which uses a custom
Nullable type for other reasons[2].  Sharing a type is useful because
Eclipse's null analysis is only able to use one Nullable type at a
time in a given workspace (so for this analysis to function in a
workspace used to develop Gerrit, JGit and Gerrit would need to use
the same Nullable type).

The new Nullable type has CLASS instead of RUNTIME retention because
there wasn't any obvious use for the annotation at run time.

Gerrit uses the Nullable annotation to communicate with Guice.  Guice
injection happens at runtime, so it needs to be able to read the
@Nullable annotations at run time.  Otherwise Guice produces
provisioning errors, such as

 3) null returned by binding at com.google.gerrit.lucene.LuceneChangeIndex$Factory.create()
  but parameter 7 of com.google.gerrit.lucene.LuceneChangeIndex.<init>() is not @Nullable

Switch to RUNTIME retention to avoid this.

While at it, update the javadoc to explain more clearly how this
annotation relates to other Nullable types[3].  This should make it
clearer why JGit needed another Nullable type:

 A. Avoiding dependency on Java 8
 B. RUNTIME retention to allow Guice to read the annotation at run time
 C. Named Nullable so Guice can recognize the annotation
 D. Not an addition to Java EE's javax. annotation package, to avoid
    the split-package problem[2] that prevents the annotation from
    being readable at run time when loaded from an OSGi container
 E. Avoiding heavyweight dependencies, deprecated dependencies, and
    dependencies on package internals

While at it, move the check on tree entry d/e/f/g.y into two separate
tests: one to check that it doesn't match any of the configured paths,
and another to check that it does not throw StopWalkException to end
the walk early.

PathFilter and PathFilterGroup form JGit's implementation of git's
path-limiting feature in commands like log and diff.  To save time
when traversing trees, a path specification

	foo/bar/baz

tells the tree walker not to traverse unrelated trees like qux/.  It
does that by returning false from include when the tree walker is
visiting qux and true when it is visiting foo.

Unfortunately that test was implemented to be slightly over-eager: it
doesn't only return true when asked whether to visit a subtree ""foo""
but when asked about a plain file ""foo"" as well.  As a result, diffs
and logs restricted to some-file/non-existing-suffix unexpectedly
match against some-file:

Fix it by checking against the entry's mode.

Gitiles +log has the same bug and benefits from the same fix.

Callers know not to worry about what subtrees are included in the tree
walk because shouldBeRecursive() returns true in this case, so this
behavior change should be safe.  This also better matches the behavior
of C git:

Track the ""refs/"" directory as a root tree by storing references
that point directly at an object as a GITLINK entry in the tree.
For example ""refs/heads/master"" is written as ""heads/master"".

Annotated tags also store their peeled value with ^{} suffix, using
""tags/v1.0"" and ""tags/v1.0^{}"" GITLINK entries.

Symbolic references are written as SYMLINK entries with the blob of
the symlink carrying the name of the symbolic reference target.

HEAD is outside of ""refs/"" namespace so it is stored as a special
""..HEAD"" entry. This name is chosen because "".."" is not valid in
a reference name and it almost looks like ""../HEAD"" which names
HEAD if the reader was inside of the ""refs/"" directory.

A group of updates can be applied by updating the tree in one step.
A new Command type is required to handle symbolic references and
peeled references.

Instead of storing references in the local filesystem rely on the
RefTree rooted at refs/txn/committed.  This avoids needing to store
references in the packed-refs file by keeping all data rooted under
a single refs/txn/committed ref.

Performance to scan all references from a well packed RefTree is very
close to reading the packed-refs file from local disk.

Storing a packed RefTree is smaller due to pack file compression,
about 49.39 bytes/ref (on average) compared to packed-refs using
~65.49 bytes/ref.

Currently execution of tests in pgm uses CLIGitCommand which
re-implements few things from Main. Unfortunately this can results in a
different test behavior compared to the real CLI runtime.

The change let CLIGitCommand extend Main and only slightly modifies the
runtime (stream redirection and undesired exit() termination).

v2.1 was stored very far away in the tree relative to v2.1 itself as
^ sorts in the ASCII/UTF-8 encoding very after all other common tag
characters like digits and dots.

Use "" ^"" instead as space is not valid in a reference name, sorts
before all other valid reference characters (thus forcing next entry
locality) and this looks like a peeled marker for the prior tag.

The AmazonS3Repository pre-signs download and upload requests.

AWS access and secret key are expected to be in the
$HOME/.aws/credentials file in the following format:

[default]
  accessKey = ...
  secretKey = ...

Use AWS version 4 request signing because it is more secure and
supported by all regions. The version 3 signing is not supported in
newer regions.

TODO:
- implement getVerifyAction() and do actual verification. Subclasses of
S3Repository can implement caching for object meta data (size) in order
to avoid extra roundtrips to S3. Verification should ensure that meta
data store and content of S3 storage are in sync
- HEAD request used in S3Repository.getSize() seems to always return
Content-length 0 in contrast to the documentation [1]. So getSize() does
detect if the object exists in S3 or not but in case the object exists
it always returns size 0

Remove all proxy rules, that were introduced to allow to build Gerrit
with hijacked JGit cell. New approach suggested in: [1], that emulates
real JGit project structure in its own cell, makes them unnecessary.

Add :all rule, that build all artifacts and packages them in zip file.
Add shell binary :jgit_bin rule, that allows to execute JGit binary
from with buck run command, e.g.:

  $ buck run jgit_bin status
  $ buck run jgit_bin -- --version

There's only one test method in this module and it's quite long, so
rather than using a try-with-resource and having to indent a huge
block of existing code, make the Git a member variable that gets
initialised and closed in @Before and @After annotated methods.

The methods are named 'before' and 'after' rather than the conventional
'setUp' and 'tearDown' so as not to conflict with the names of the
existing methods in LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase.

This was always the intent of the implementation but it was being

14dfa70520 fixed the problem that HEAD wasn't added to the reftree when
rebuilding the reftree in an empty repository where HEAD isn't yet
resolvable. Since non-resolvable refs are filtered out by
RefDatabase.getRefs(ALL) we have to add HEAD to the reftree explicitly
in this special case.

This fix resulted in another bug: rebuilding the reftree in a repository
which has a resolvable HEAD failed with a DirCacheNameConflictException
in RefTree.apply(). If HEAD is resolvable RefDatabase.getRefs(ALL) does
not filter out HEAD. This results in two identical CREATE commands for
HEAD which RefTree.apply() refuses to execute.

Fix this by no longer creating a duplicate CREATE command for HEAD.

a few use cases where we handle TREEs and not BLOBs and are required to

like to retrieve this info directly from their instead of TreeWalking
the (huge!) repositories again. So if it was possible could we change

JGit's Garbage Collector is repacking relevant objects into new
packfiles and is afterwards deleting the now obsolete packfiles. But to
prevent problems caused by race conditions JGit was not deleting
packfiles when they are too young. The same mechanism as for loose
objects and the config parameter gc.pruneExpire was used.
But JGit was reusing the parameter gc.pruneExpire also for packfiles
which may cause a lot of filesystem consumption if gc.pruneExpire was
set to the default of 2 weeks. Only two weeks after packfile creation gc
was allowed to delete this packfile.

This change introduces a new config paramter gc.prunePackExpire with a
default of ""1.hour"". This parameter is used when packfiles are deleted.
Only packfiles older than the specified time can be deleted.

For loose objects the behaviour is not changed and only the old
parameter gc.pruneExpire is relevant.

PackWriter.writeObject() can get into an infinite loop when corrupt
packs are present. When it finds a pack file with an object that can be
reused it calls DfsPackFile.copyAsIs(). If that method sees an invalid
CRC, it adds the object to the DfsPackFile's corrupt object list and
throws a CorruptObjectException, which it later catches as an
IOException and wraps in a
StoredObjectRepresentationNotAvailableException.
PackWriter.writeObjectImpl() catches that SORNAE and retries the
operation by calling DfsReader.selectObjectRepresentation(). But
currently that method returns the same object which was just seen to
be corrupt.

Change DfsPackFile.isCorrupt() from private to package private, and use
that method in DfsReader.selectObjectRepresentation() to filter out
corrupt objects.

With the auto option, gc checks whether any housekeeping is required; if
not, it exits without performing any work. Some JGit commands run gc
--auto after performing operations that could create many loose objects.
Housekeeping is required if there are too many loose objects or too many
packs in the repository.

If the number of loose objects exceeds the value of the gc.auto option,
then all loose objects are combined into a single pack using repack -d
-l. Setting the value of gc.auto to 0 disables automatic packing of
loose objects.

If the number of packs exceeds the value of gc.autoPackLimit, then
existing packs (except those marked with a .keep file) are consolidated
into a single pack by using the -A option of repack. Setting
gc.autoPackLimit to 0 disables automatic consolidation of packs.

Like git the following jgit commands run auto gc:
- fetch
- merge
- rebase
- receive-pack

The auto gc for receive-pack can be suppressed by setting the config
option receive.autogc = false

Before this change, jgit used to read packed-refs before scanning
loose refs. That was not a problem if gc didn't run concurrently. When
gc did run concurrently with such refs reading, that order sometimes
broke the latter. This lead to reading an older version of a ref's
tip, which meant ""losing"" the real tip or commit. The specific
read-Vs-gc concurrency scenario which broke reading that way follows:

1. let ref R be in packed-refs and R' be in loose
2. jgit starts reading packed-refs
3. gc also starts its business around that very time
4. jgit still has the time to read R from packed-refs
5. as gc is not done yet updating packed-refs with R'
6. jgit then starts scanning loose refs (or is about to)
7. gc quickly ends up being done moving loose R' to packed-refs
8. so gc (quickly) removes loose refs
9. -while jgit is scanning loose refs, now gone
10. so jgit assumes no loose to consider => packed-refs wining
11. so jgit wrongfully returns R (from 4.) as the tip, instead of R'.

This fix switches the order so loose refs are scanned (secured) before
taking the time to read packed-refs. This way, knowledge of the
likelier tip is guaranteed for ref reading to return the true tip
- despite concurrent gc. If there is no loose ref to scan, jgit reads
packed-refs and lands on R' (or S), which it then returns, as
expected. The gerrit issue [1] should be solved by this fix.

We've found in Gerrit Code Review that it is common to pass around
both an ObjectReader (or more commonly a RevWalk wrapping one) and an
ObjectInserter. These code paths often assume that the ObjectReader
can read back any objects created by the ObjectInserter without
flushing. However, we previously had no way to enforce that constraint
programmatically, leading to hard-to-spot problems.

Provide a potential solution by exposing the ObjectInserter that
created an ObjectReader, when known. Callers can either continue
passing both objects and check:
  reader.getCreatedFromInserter() == inserter
or they can just pass around ObjectReader and extract the inserter
when it's needed (checking that it's not null at usage time).

There was a bug regarding how JGit handled untracked files when applying
a stash. Problem was that untracked files are applied by doing a merge
of HEAD and untrackedFiles commit with a merge base of the stashed HEAD.
That's wrong because the untrackedFiles commit has no parent and
contains only the untracked files. Using stashed HEAD as merge base
leads to unneccessary conflicts on files not event included in the
untrackedFiles commit.

Imagine this graph directly before you want to apply a stash which was
based on 0. You want to apply the stash on current HEAD commit 5.

  5 (HEAD,master)
 /
0---+
 \   \
  1---3 (WIP on master)
     /
    2 (untracked files on master)

Imagine for a specific (tracked) file f
- commit 0 contains X
- HEAD contains Y
- commit 2 (the untracked files) does not contain file f

A merge of 2 and 5 with a merge base of 0 leads to a conflict. The 5
commit wants to modify the file and the 2 commit wants to delete the
file -> conflict.

If no merge base is set then the semantic is correct.

Thanks to Bow for finding this bug and providing the test case.

JGit supports clean filters defined in repository configuration. The
filters are implemented as external programs filtering content by
accepting the original content (as seen in the working tree) on stdin
and which emit the filtered content on stdout. To run such a filter JGit
has start a external process and pump data into/from this process.

This commit adds support for builtin clean filters which are implemented
in java and which are executed by jgit's main thread. When a filter is
defined in the configuration as
""jgit://builtin/<filterDriverName>/clean"" then JGit will lookup in a
static map whether a builtin filter is registered under this name. If
found such a filter is called to do the filtering.

The functionality in this commit requires that a program using JGit
explicitly calls the JGit API to register builtin implementations for
specific clean filters. In follow-up commits configuration parameters
will be added which trigger such registrations. Other commits will add
builtin implementations for lfs clean filters.

There are references which are returned by
RefDatabase.getAdditionalRefs() which are allowed to point to
non-existing objects. These refs should not save objects from being
garbage collected. Examples for these references are ORIG_HEAD,
MERGE_HEAD, FETCH_HEAD and CHERRY_PICK_HEAD. Native git will not take
these references into account when doing a gc and therefore these
references may point to non-existing objects after a gc. Teach JGit's
GC to behave the same: ignore additional refs if they don't start with
""refs/"". Examples for refs returned by getAdditionalRefs() which do
start with ""refs/"" are the bootstrap refs when using reftree's (see
commit 115f1ad3974d1162b33d1c8eff466019d1f249f3). See also

JGit failed to do checkouts when the index contained smudged entries and
autocrlf was on. In such cases the WorkingTreeIterator calculated the
SHA1 sometimes on content which was not correctly filtered. The SHA1 was
computed on content which two times went through a lf->crlf conversion.

We used to tell the treewalk whether it is a checkin or checkout
operation and always use the related filters when reading any content.
If on windows and autocrlf is true and we do a checkout operation then
we always used a lf->crlf conversion on any text content. That's not
correct. Even during a checkout we sometimes need the crlf->lf
conversion. E.g. when calculating the content-id for working-tree
content we need to use crlf->lf filtering although the overall operation
type is checkout.

Often this bug does not have effects because we seldom compute the
content-id of filesystem content during a checkout. But we do need to
know whether a file is dirty or not before we overwrite it during a
checkout. And if the index entries are smudged we don't trust the index
and compute filesystem-content-sha1's explicitly.

This caused EGit not to be able to switch branches anymore on windows
when autocrlf was true. EGit denied the checkout because it thought
workingtree files are dirty because content-sha1 are computed on wrongly
filtered content.

JGits PushCommand and BasePackPushConnection were throwing a generic
exception when the pushed pack-file was rejected by the server since it
contained too large objects. Teach JGit to better analyze the server's
response to detect this situation and throw a more specific exception.

Detect this situation by parsing the status line sent by the server.
This change only recognizes the response sent by a JGit based server.
All other servers which report such problems in a different way still
lead to a generic TransportExceptions.

Before this fix, ref directory removal did not work. That was because
the ref lock file was still in the leaf directory at deletion time.
Hence no deep ref directories were ever deleted, which negatively
impacted gc performance under large directory structure circumstances.

This fix removes the ref lock file before attempting to delete the ref
directory (which includes it); applies to the leaf directory solely.
The other deep parent directories are therefore now successfully
deleted in turn, since leaf's content (lock file) gets removed first.

The ref lock file is still also removed in the calling block's finally
clause, just in case, as before. Such double-unlock brought by this
fix is harmless (a no-op).

A new (private) RefDirectory#delete method is introduced to support
this gc-specific case; other RefDirectory#delete callers remain
untouched.

setInput should always push at least 1 byte into the Inflater.  If 0
bytes (or negative!) are being sent the DfsBlock is inconsistent with
the position passed in.  This indicates a severe programming problem
in the caller, and may cause an infinite loop in DfsReader.

Today we saw a handful of live examples of this but don't know what
the cause is.  Guard against this error condition and throw with a
more verbose failure, which may prevent an infinite loop.  Callers
will eventually catch DataFormatException and rethrow with more detail
about the object that cannot be inflated, with the DFE in the chain.

When Repository.close() decrements the useCount to 0 currently the cache
immediately evicts the repository from WindowCache and RepositoryCache.
This leads to I/O overhead on busy repositories because pack files and
references are inserted and deleted from the cache frequently.

This commit defers the eviction of a repository from the caches until
last use of the repository is older than time to live. The eviction is
handled by a background task running periodically.

The native wire protocol sends ref advertisements in the pkt-line
format, which requires encoding the ObjectId and ref name onto a byte
sequence.  Busy servers show this is a very high source of garbage,
which pushes the garbage collector harder when there are many refs in
the repository (e.g.  70k, in a Gerrit managed repository).

Optimize the side band advertiser by retaining the CharsetEncoder,
minimizing the amount of temporary garbage built during encoding.

Google's internal version of DfsObjDatabase enforces this ordering of
packs by fixing up lastModified timestamps to match try and force an
ordering of:

  INSERT / RECEIVE
  COMPACT
  GC (heads)
  GC (rest)
  UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE

This has provided decent performance for object lookups as starting
from an arbitrary reference may find the content in a newer pack
created by DfsObjectInserter, a ReceivePack server. Compaction of
recent packs also contains newer content, and then most interesting
data is in the ""main"" GC pack.

Add a new GC_REST PackSource allows the DfsGarbageCollector to
identify to the pack ordering code which pack is which, so the
non-heads are scanned 2nd during reads.  This removes a hack that was
unique to Google's implementation that enforced this behavior by
fixing up the lastModified timestamp.

Renumber the PackSource's categories to reflect this ordering.

If the push client has requested side-band support the server can
signal a fatal error parsing the pack using the error channel (3)
and then hang up. This may cause the PackWriter to fail to write to
data onto the network socket, which throws a misleading error back
up to the application and the user.

During a write failure poll the input to see if the side band system
can parse out an error message off channel 3. This should be fast as
there will either be an error present in the buffer, or the remote will
also have hung-up on the side band channel. In the case of a hang-up
just rethrow the original IOException as its a network error.

This roughly matches what C git does; once commands are sent and the
packer is started a new thread runs in the background to decode any
possible server error during unpacking on the remote peer

If the client sent a well-formed enough request to see it wants to use
side-band-64k for status reporting (meaning its a modern client), but
any other command record was somehow invalid (e.g. corrupt SHA-1)
report the parsing exception using channel 3.  This allows clients to
see the failure and know the server will not be continuing.

git-core and JGit clients send all commands and then start a sideband
demux before sending the pack. By consuming all commands first we get
the client into a state where it can see and respond to the channel 3
server failure.

This behavior is useful on HTTPS connections when the client is buggy
and sent a corrupt command, but still managed to request side-band-64k
in the first line.

Place a configurable upper bound on the amount of command data
received from clients during `git push`.  The limit is applied to the
encoded wire protocol format, not the JGit in-memory representation.
This allows clients to flexibly use the limit; shorter reference names
allow for more commands, longer reference names permit fewer commands
per batch.

Based on data gathered from many repositories at $DAY_JOB, the average
reference name is well under 200 bytes when encoded in UTF-8 (the wire
encoding).  The new 3 MiB default receive.maxCommandBytes allows about
11,155 references in a single `git push` invocation.  A Gerrit Code
Review system with six-digit change numbers could still encode 29,399
references in the 3 MiB maxCommandBytes limit.

Currently, there is a race where a user of a DfsRepository in a single
thread may get unexpected MissingObjectExceptions trying to look up an
object that appears as the current value of a ref:

1. Thread A scans packs before scanning refs, for example by reading
   an object by SHA-1.
2. Thread B flushes an object and updates a ref to point to that
   object.
3. Thread A looks up the ref updated in (2). Since it is scanning refs
   for the first time, it sees the new object SHA-1.
4. Thread A tries to read the object it found in (3), using the cached
   pack list it got from (1). The object appears missing.

Allow implementations to work around this by marking the object
database's current pack list as ""dirty."" A dirty pack list means that
DfsReader will rescan packs and try again if a requested object is
missing. Implementations should mark objects as dirty any time the ref
database reads or scans refs that might be newer than a previously
cached pack list.

When doing a detaching operation, JGit fakes a SymbolicRef as an ObjectIdRef.
This is because RefUpdate#updateImpl dereferences the SymbolicRef when updating
it. For example, assume that HEAD is pointing refs/heads/master. If I try to
make a detached HEAD pointing to a commit 0xc0ffee, RefUpdate dereferences HEAD
as refs/heads/master first and changes refs/heads/master to 0xc0ffee.
The detach argument of RefDatabase#newUpdate avoids this dereference by faking
HEAD as ObjectIdRef.

This faking is problematic for the linking operation of DfsRefDatabase. It does
a compare-and-swap operation on every reference change because of its
distributed systems nature. If a SymbolicRef is faked as an ObjectRef, it thinks
that there was a change in the reference and rejects the update. Because of
this, DFS based repositories cannot change the link target of symbolic refs.
This has not been a problem for file-based repositories because it has a
file-lock based semantics instead of the CAS based one. The reference
implementation, InMemoryRepository, has a hack to revert the reference back to a
SymbolicRef.

When [1] introduced this faking code, there was no way for RefUpdate to
distinguish the detaching operation. When [2] fixed the detaching operation, it
introduced a detachingSymbolicRef flag. This commit uses this flag to control
whether it needs to dereference the symbolic refs by calling Ref#getLeaf. The
same flag is used to the reflog update operation. As a side-effect,
InMemoryRepository's compareAndPut implementation becomes a straightforward CAS
operation.

DfsRefDatabase#compareAndPut had a vague semantics for reference
matching. Because of this, an operation to make a symbolic
reference had been broken for some DFS implementations even if they
followed the contract of compareAndPut. The clarified semantics
requires the implementations to satisfy the followings:

* Matching references should be both symbolic references or both
  object ID references.
* If both are symbolic references, both should have the same target
  name.
* If both are object ID references, both should have the same object
  ID.

This semantics is defined based on
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77416/. Before this commit,
DfsRefDatabase couldn't see the target of symbolic references.

InMemoryRepository is changed to comply with the new semantics. This
semantics change can affect the existing DFS implementations that only
checks object IDs. This commit adds two tests that the previous
InMemoryRepository couldn't pass.

'refs/heads/' was configured with the intention to mean 'refs/heads/*'.

The first expression lacks the '*', which is why it is not considered
a wildcard but it was considered valid and so was not found early to be
a typo.

Refs are not allowed to end with '/' anyway, so add a check for that.

Gerrits superproject subscription feature uses RefSpecs to formalize
the ACLs of when the superproject subscription feature is allowed.

As this is a slightly different use case than describing a local/remote
pair of refs, we need to be more permissive. Specially we want to allow:

    refs/heads/*
    refs/heads/*:refs/heads/master
    refs/heads/master:refs/heads/*

Introduce a new constructor, that allows constructing these refs specs.

as untracked files, which would result in a non-recursive delete being
called on them, which would fail as they are directories. This commit
addresses that issue in the following ways.
First, repositories are now listed with untrackedFolders so that a
recursive delete will be used, which is appropriate. Second,
repositories are skipped in a default clean, similarly to cgit and only
cleaned when the force flag is applied.

When doing an incremental fetch from JGit, ""have"" commits are marked
as ""uninteresting"". In a non-shallow fetch, when the RevWalk hits an
""uninteresting"" commit it marks the commit's corresponding tree as
uninteresting. That has the effect of dropping those trees and all the
trees and blobs they reference out of the thin pack returned to the
client.

However, shallow fetches use a DepthWalk to limit the RevWalk, which
nearly always causes the RevWalk to terminate before encountering the
""have"" commits. As a result the pack created for the incremental fetch
never encounters ""uninteresting"" tree objects and thus includes
duplicate objects that it knows the client already has.

When there is a commit that a client reports as both a ""have"" and a 
""shallow"", if the ""want"" is the direct parent of of this
""have-and-shallow"" commit then no objects are returned in the pack.

UploadPack takes its RevWalk, invokes toObjectWalkWithSameObjects() on
it and supplies the resulting ObjectWalk to PackWriter. For non-
shallow fetches PackWriter uses this ObjectWalk to lookup RevCommits,
but in shallow fetches this ObjectWalk is thrown out and a new
DepthWalk.ObjectWalk is created.

The problem is that UploadPack called RevWalk.assumeShallow() for the
RevCommits corresponding to the client's shallows. That clears out
the RevCommit's parents, which prevents the propagation of the
""uninteresting"" flag to the parent commits of the ""have-and-shallow"" 
commits. But since the ObjectWalk is currently being thrown out, the
assumeShallow() state is lost, and the ""uninteresting"" state is being
propagated to these parents. That results in the server thinking it
shouldn't send objects corresponding to these ""want"" commits.

Attempting to fetch a deeper ancestor of a ""have-and-shallow"" commit
does not exhibit this bug because new RevWalk starts with no
RevCommits. RevCommits are only created for ""haves"" and ""wants"" and
their direct parents but not for deeper ancestors. So when the ""haves""
are marked as uninteresting, that marking stops at their direct
parents. Thus the ""want"" that is a deeper ancestor is not marked.

cgit changed the --depth parameter to mean the total depth of history
rather than the depth of ancestors to be returned [1]. JGit still uses
the latter meaning, so update it to match cgit.

depth=0 still means a non-shallow clone. depth=1 now means only the
wants rather than the wants and their direct parents.

This is accomplished by changing the semantic meaning of ""depth"" in
UploadPack and PackWriter to mean the total depth of history desired,
while keeping ""depth"" in DepthWalk.{RevWalk,ObjectWalk} to mean
the depth of traversal. Thus UploadPack and PackWriter always
initialize their DepthWalks with ""depth-1"".

BranchConfig treated this config property as a boolean, but git also
allows the values ""preserve"" and ""interactive"". Config property
pull.rebase also allows the same values.

Replace private enum PullCommand.PullRebaseMode by new public enum
BranchConfig.BranchRebaseMode and adapt all uses. Add a new setter to
PullCommand.

Note: PullCommand will treat ""interactive"" like ""true"", i.e., as a
non-interactive rebase. Not sure how ""interactive"" should be handled.
At least it won't balk on it.

The git-lfs specification [1] describes the following optional status codes
that may be returned:

429 - The user has hit a rate limit with the server. Though the API does
      not specify any rate limits, implementors are encouraged to set some
      for availability reasons.

509 - Returned if the bandwidth limit for the user or repository has been
      exceeded. The API does not specify any bandwidth limit, but implementors
      may track usage.

Add two new exception classes to represent these cases. Implementations may
throw these from #getLargeFileRepository(), causing the corresponding HTTP
status codes to be returned to the client.

OpenJDK replaces the underlying OutputStream with NullOutputStream when
the process exits. This throws IOException for all write operation. When
it exits before JGit writes the input to the pipe buffer, the input
stays in BufferedOutputStream. The close method tries to write it again,
and IOException is thrown.

Since we ignore IOException in StreamGobbler, we also ignore it when
we close the stream.

Some embeddings of JGit require creating a ReceivePack instance in
another process from the one that handled the network socket with the
client.  Similar to the PushCertificate add a setter to allow the
option list to be supplied.

There was a bug when carrying over flags from a merge commit to its non-first
parents. The first parent of a merge commit was handled differently and correct
but the non-first parents are handled by a recursive algorithm. Flags should be
copied from the root merge commit to parent-2, to grandparent-2, ... up to the
limit of STACK_DEPTH==500 parents-levels. But the recursive algorithm  was
always copying only to the direct parents of the merge commit and not the
grand*-parents.

This seems to be no problem when commits are handled in a strict date order
because then copying only one level is no problem if children are handled
before parents. But when commits are not seperated anymore by distinctive
correct dates (e.g. because all commits have the same date) then it may happen
that a merge-parent is handled before the merge commit and when dealing later
with the merge commit one has to copy flags down to more than one level

on the Windows platform when Checkout wanted to delete files but the
filesystem doesn't allow this. The situation is more seldom on linux/mac
because open filehandles don't stop a deletion attempt and checkout
succeeds more often.

lowercase while ""https_proxy"" can be lowercase or uppercase (means:
""HTTPS_PROXY""). lowercase has precedence. This can be looked up in

Additionally teach JGit not to interprete the environment variables if
the java process was explicitly started with the system properties

The 'factory' field is lazy initialized in the detect() method.

According to FindBugs:

   Because the compiler or processor may reorder instructions, threads
   are not guaranteed to see a completely initialized object, if the
   method can be called by multiple threads.

Fix this by declaring the member as 'volatile'.

Note that serializing a RevCommit or RevTag may serialize quite a few

references.

Relying on soft references is not working, especially in large heap. The
JVM GC will consider collecting soft references as last resort before
throwing an out of memory error. For example, an application like Gerrit
configured with a 128GB heap, GC will wait until all 128GB is filled
before collecting the soft references so the application will be
suffering long pauses caused by GC for a long time already. In other
words, you will have to restart application because it's unusable before
JVM eviction kicks in.

Keeping the SoftReference in RepositoryCache is causing more harm than
good. If you use the time based eviction (which is the default strategy)
and want to tune JVM to release soft references more aggressively, it
will release repositories from the cache even though they are not
expired which defeats the purpose of the repository cache.

Gerrit uses Lucene library which uses soft references and this is
causing a ""memory leak"" except if you configure JVM to release soft
references more aggressively which have the nasty side effect of
evicting non expired repositories from the cache.

Java 8 fixed the silent flush during close issue by

it is no longer necessary to override close() or have

Fix JGits merge-base calculation in case of inconsistent commit times.
JGit was potentially failing to compute correct merge-bases when the
commit times where inconsistent (a parent commit was younger than a
child commit). The code in MergeBaseGenerator was aware of the fact that
sometimes the discovery of a merge base x can occur after the parents of
x have been seen (see comment in #carryOntoOne()). But in the light of
inconsistent commit times it was possible that these parents of a
merge-base have already been returned as a merge-base.

This commit only contains a test illustrating this bug. I am still
working on a effective fix.

info/http-alternates, info/packs, ../packed-refs, ../{ref}. All of these
path are called by openReader() which calls open(). It may be easier to
add a flag for openReader() in open(), but the interface is implemented
by other two subclasses.

FileSnapshot.isModified may report a file beeing clean although is
acutally dirty.

Imagine you have a FileSnapshot on file f. lastmodified and lastread are
both t0. Now time is t1 and you
1) modify the file
2) Update the FileSnapshot of the file (lastModified=t1, lastRead=t1)
3) modify the file again
4) wait 3 seconds
5) Ask the Filesnapshot whether the file is dirty or not. It will answer
it's clean.

Every file which has been modified longer than 2.5 seconds ago will be
reported to be clean. That's not always correct as the test shows.

The real-world problem fixed by this is the following:
A gerrit server using JGit to handle git repositories is answering fetch
requests while simultaniously native git is doing a garbage collection
on the repo. At time t1 native git writes temporary files in the pack
folder causing the mtime of the pack folder to be set to t1. A fetch
request causes JGit to search for new packfiles and JGit remembers this
scan in a Filesnapshot on the packs folder. Since the gc is not finished
JGit doesn't see any new packfiles. The fetch is processed and the gc
ends while the filesystem timer is still t1. The gc caused a new
packfile beeing written and the old packfiles to be deleted.

3 seconds later another fetch comes. JGit does not yet now about the new
packfile but is also not rescanning the pack folder because he
remembered the last scan was during t1 and packfolder mtime is also t1.
Now JGit will not be able to resolve any object. This behaviour is
persistent because now gerrit can't read refs/meta/config anymore and
will not allow any pushes anymore. The packs folder will not change it's
mtime and therefore a rescan will not take place.

When a repository is being GCed and a concurrent push is received, there
is the possibility of having a missing object. This is due to the fact
that after the list of objects to delete is built, there is a window of
time when an unreferenced and ready to delete object can be referenced
by the incoming push. In that case, the object would be deleted because
there is no way to know it is no longer unreferenced. This will leave
the repository in an inconsistent state and most of the operations fail
with a missing tree/object error.

Given the incoming push change the last modified date for the now
referenced object, verify this one is still a candidate to delete
before actually performing the delete operation.

The new --preserve-oldpacks option moves old pack files into the
preserved subdirectory instead of deleting them after repacking.

The new --prune-preserved option prunes old pack files from the
preserved subdirectory after repacking, but before potentially
moving the latest old packfiles to this subdirectory.

These options are designed to prevent stale file handle exceptions
during git operations which can happen on users of NFS repos when
repacking is done on them. The strategy is to preserve old pack files
around until the next repack with the hopes that they will become
unreferenced by then and not cause any exceptions to running processes
when they are finally deleted (pruned).

This fixes a nasty performance issue for repositories that have many
objects referenced through refs/tags/, but not in refs/heads/.
Situations like this can arise when a project has made releases like
refs/tags/v1.0, and then decides to orphan history and start over for
version 2. The v1.0 objects are not reachable from master anymore,
but are still live due to the v1.0 tag.

When tags are packed in the GC_OTHER pack, bitmaps are not able to
cover the repository's contents. This may cause very slow counting
times during git clone, as the server must enumerate the ancient
history under refs/tags/ to respond to the client.

Clients by default always ask for all tags when asking for all heads
during clone. This has been true since git-core commit 8434c2f1afedb
(Apr 27 2008), when clone was converted to a builtin. Including tags
in the main GC pack should still allow servers to benefit from the
fast full pack reuse path when serving a clone to a client.

An unreferenced object might appear in a pack.  This could only happen
because it was previously referenced, and then later that reference
was removed.  When we gc, we copy the referenced objects into a new
pack, and delete the old pack.  This would remove the unreferenced
object.  Now we first create a loose object from any unreferenced
object in the doomed pack.  This kicks off the two-week grace period
for that object, after which it will be collected if it's not
referenced.

This matches the behavior of regular git.

Sometimes, it is necessary to cancel a garbage collection operation.
When GC is called using the standalone executable, i.e., from a command
line, Control-Cing the process does the trick. When calling GC
programmatically, though, there is no mechanism to do it.

Add checks in the GC process so that a custom cancellable progress
monitor could be passed in order to cancel the operation at specific
points. In this case, the calling process set the cancel flag in the
progress monitor and the GC process will throw an exception that can
be caught and handled by the caller accordingly.

In 8ac65d33ed7a94f77cb066271669feebf9b882fc PackWriter changed its
behavior to always prefer the last object representation presented
to it by the ObjectReuseAsIs implementation. This was a fix to avoid
delta chain cycles.

Unfortunately it can lead to suboptimal compression when concurrent
GCs are run on the same repository. One case is automatic GC running
(with default settings) in parallel to a manual GC that has disabled
delta reuse in order to generate new smaller deltas for the entire
history of the repository.

Running GC with no-reuse generally requires more CPU time, which
also translates to a longer running time.  This can lead to a race
where the automatic GC completes before the no-reuse GC, leaving
the repository in a state such as:

  no-reuse GC:   size 1 GiB, mtime = 18:45
  auto GC:       size 8 GiB, mtime = 17:30

With the default sort ordering, the smaller no-reuse GC pack is
sorted earlier in the pack list, due to its more recent mtime.

During object reuse in a future GC, these smaller representations
are considered first by PackWriter, but are all discarded when the
auto GC file from 17:30 is examined second (due to its older mtime).

Work around this in two ways.

Well formed DFS repositories should have at most 1 GC pack. If
2 or more GC packs exist, break the sorting tie by selecting the
smaller file earlier in the pack list. This allows all normal read
code paths to favor the smaller file, which places less pressure
on the DfsBlockCache. If any GC race happens, readers serving clone
requests will prefer the file that is smaller.

During object reuse, flip this ordering so that the smaller file is
last. This allows PackWriter to see smaller deltas last, replacing
larger representations that were previously considered from other
pack files.

Delta search was discarding discovered deltas if an object appeared
near a type boundary in the delta search window. This has caused JGit
to produce larger pack files than other implementations of the packing
algorithm.

Delta search works by pushing prior objects into a search window, an
ordered list of objects to attempt to delta compress the next object
against. (The window size is bounded, avoiding O(N^2) behavior.)

For implementation reasons multiple object types can appear in the
input list, and the window. PackWriter commonly passes both trees and
blobs in the input list handed to the DeltaWindow algorithm. The pack
file format requires an object to only delta compress against the same
type, so the DeltaWindow algorithm must stop doing comparisions if a
blob would be compared to a tree.

Because the input list is sorted by object type and the window is
recently considered prior objects, once a wrong type is discovered in
the window the search algorithm stops and uses the current result.

Unfortunately the termination condition was discarding any found
delta by setting deltaBase and deltaBuf to null when it was trying
to break the window search.

When this bug occurs, the state of the DeltaWindow looks like this:

                                 current
                                  |
                                 \ /
  input list:  tree0 tree1 blob1 blob2

  window:      blob1 tree1 tree0
                / \
                 |
              res.prev

As the loop iterates to the right across the window, it first finds
that blob1 is a suitable delta base for blob2, and temporarily holds
this in the bestDelta/deltaBuf fields. It then considers tree1, but
tree1 has the wrong type (blob != tree), so the window loop must give
up and fall through the remaining code.

Moving the break condition up allows the bestDelta/deltaBuf to be
kept, letting the final file delta compress blob1 against blob0.

The impact of this bug (and its fix) on real world repositories is
likely minimal. The boundary from blob to tree happens approximately
once in the search, as the input list is sorted by type. Only the
first window size worth of blobs (e.g. 250) were failing to produce
a delta in the final file.

This bug fix does produce significantly different results for small
test repositories created in the unit test suite, such as when a pack
may contains 6 objects (2 commits, 2 trees, 2 blobs).  Packing test
cases can now better sample different output pack file sizes depending

In a DFS repository the DfsGarbageCollector will typically attempt
delta compression while creating the three main pack files: GC,
GC_REST and GC_TXN. Include all of these in the wasDeltaAttempted()
decision so that future packers can bypass delta compression of
non-delta objects.

If the pruneexpire config is set to ""now"", then any unreferenced loose
objects are immediately eligible for gc.  So there is no need to
actually write the loose objects.

Users who run hosting services which sometimes accept large, entirely
garbage packs might set the following configurations:

gc.pruneExpire = now
gc.prunePackExpire = 2.weeks

Then garbage objects will be kept around in packs, but after two weeks
the packs themselves will get deleted.

For client-side users of jgit, the default settings will loosen
garbage objects, and, after an hour, delete the old packs in which
they resided.

The TreeWalk filtering classes need to support the tenary
state that the path comparison generates.
A new path comparison method (isPathMatch) is created with
three distinct return values (isPathPrefix use value '0' to
encode two of these) which will makes it possible for the logical
operatiors (especially NOT) to aggregate a correct verdict.

A filter like: AND(Path(""path"", NOT(Path(""path/to/other""))))
Should filter out 'path/to/other/file', but not 'path/to/my/file'.

The path-limiting feature when testing path/to/my/file, would
result to run test for the following paths:

    path
    path/to
    path/to/my
    path/to/my/file

isPathPrefix('path/to/other') will return '0' for the first two
and since there is no way for NOT to distinguish between a exact
match and a match indicating that the tested path is a 'parent',
it will incorrectly return false and thus remove everything below
'path' immediately.
isPathMatch has a distingushed value for 'parent' matches that
will be preserved throught the logic operators and should not
cause an overeager removal of paths.

The functionality of isPathPrefix is required by other parts
and is untouched.

Unit test are included to ensure that the logical functionality
is correct and can be preserved.

limits it was necessary to move the LimitedInputStream out of the
PacketLineIn and further down to the PackParser. Unfortuantely this
didn't survive review, as a buggy test failed and the ""fix"" was to
drop this part of the code.

The maxPackSizeLimit should apply to the pack stream, not the pkt-line
framing used to send commands to control the ReceivePack instance. The
commands are controlled using a different limit. The failing test allowed
too many bytes in the pack and was only failing because it was including
the command framing. The correct fix for the test was simply to drop the
limit lower, to more closely match the actual pack size.

Generate names for objects using only the pure Java SHA1
implementation, but continue using MessageDigest in tests.
This opens the possibility of changing the hashing function
to incorporate additional safety measures, such as those
used in sha1dc[1].

Since MessageDigest has higher throughput, continue using
MessageDigest for computing pack, idx and DirCache trailers.
These are less likely to be sensitive to SHAttered[2] types
of attacks, as Git uses them to detect random bit flips
during transfer, and not for content identity.

Update SHA1 class to include a Java port of sha1dc[1]'s ubc_check,
which can detect the attack pattern used by the authors of
SHAttered[2] and run SHA-1 for additional rounds, making the hash
harder to predict.

Given the shattered example files that have the same SHA-1, this
modified implementation can identify there is risk of collision given
only one file in the pair, and returns a different hash:

When JGit detects probability of a collision, SHA1 now warns on the
logger, reporting the safe hash that was returned to JGit for use in
object names and data structures.

From the paper[3] by Marc Stevens, the probability of a false positive
identification of a collision is about 14 * 2^(-160), sufficiently low
enough for any detected collision to likely be a real collision.

git-core[4] may adopt sha1dc before the system migrates to an entirely
new hash function.  This commit enables JGit to remain compatible with
that move to sha1dc, and help protect users by warning if similar
attacks as SHAttered are identified.

Performance declined about 8% (detection off), now:

  MessageDigest        240.81 MiB/s
  MessageDigest        247.91 MiB/s
  MessageDigest        244.33 MiB/s
  MessageDigest        244.00 MiB/s

  SHA1                 219.00 MiB/s  (was ~240.825 MiB/s)
  SHA1                 222.01 MiB/s
  SHA1                 222.11 MiB/s
  SHA1                 220.85 MiB/s

This decline in throughput is attributed to the step loop unrolling in
compress(), which was necessary to easily fit the UbcCheck logic into
the hash function.  Using helper functions s1-s4 reduces the code
explosion, providing acceptable throughput.

With detection enabled (default):

  SHA1 detectCollision 151.88 MiB/s
  SHA1 detectCollision 152.55 MiB/s
  SHA1 detectCollision 146.20 MiB/s
  SHA1 detectCollision 151.47 MiB/s

  sha1dc (native C)   ~206.28 MiB/s
  sha1dc (native C)   ~204.47 MiB/s
  sha1dc (native C)   ~203.74 MiB/s

Average time to hash 4100 bytes (such as a commit or tree) for the
various algorithms available to JGit also shows SHA1 is slower than
MessageDigest, but by an acceptable margin:

  MessageDigest        18 usec
  SHA1                 20 usec
  SHA1 detectCollision 26 usec

Time to index-pack for git.git (217982 objects, 69 MiB) has increased:

  MessageDigest   SHA1 w/ detectCollision
  -------------   -----------------------
         20.12s   27.75s
         19.87s   28.04s
         20.04s   27.88s

    avg  20.01s   27.89s    +39%

Being in Java is with these additional safety checks is clearly a
penalty, but throughput is still acceptable given the increased
security against object name collisions.

5e8e2179b218ede7d14b69dc5149b0691b5859cf (Update Jetty to
9.4.1.v201470120, 2017-01-26) updated Jetty in the maven build.
Update the buck build to match so buck builds work again.

The buck build will go away soon, but in the meantime (until the bazel
build gets the same level of support) it is convenient as a faster way
of running tests than using maven.

The bazel build doesn't need this change since it doesn't build or run
http tests yet.

The submodule.name.fetchRecurseSubmodules value was being read from the
configuration of the submodule, but it should be read from the config
of the parent repository.

Also, the fetch.recurseSubmodules value from the parent repository's
configuration was not being considered at all.

Fix both of these and add tests. Now the precedence of the recurse mode
is determined as follows:

 1. Value passed to the API
 2. Value configured in submodule.name.fetchRecurseSubmodules
 3. Value configured in fetch.recurseSubmodules

The FileNotFoundException is typically raised in three conditions:
1. file doesn't exist
2. incompatible read vs. read/write open modes
3. filesystem locking
4. temporary lack of resources (e.g. too many open files)

1. is already managed, 2. would never happen as packs are not
overwritten while with 3. and 4. it is worth logging the exception and
retry to read the pack again.

Log transient errors using an exponential backoff strategy to avoid
flooding the logs with the same error if consecutive retries to access
the pack fail repeatedly.

The 3-way merge was incorrectly removing deleted sections from both
sides, when only one of two repeating sections is deleted. This is
because the the diff step can inconsistently remove one section from
side, and the other section from the other side.

There fix augments the final ""tidy-up"" stage in DiffAlgorithm to apply
to both INSERTs and DELETEs to reduce this inconsistency, and provides
some test cases to verify the fix.

A packfile random file open operation may fail with a
FileNotFoundException even if the file exists, possibly
for temporary lack of resources.

Instead of managing the FileNotFoundException as any generic
IOException it is best to still throw the exeption but prevent
the packfile for being flagged as invalid until it is actually
opened and read successfully or unsuccessfully.

Because objects described by the client using ""have"" lines do not need
to be reachable by any ref on the server, it is possible for them to
point to missing objects in the reachability graph.  When such an
object is encountered, f5368dc97f564cf5eac3e7e2742680bf2f95fc0b (Only
throw MissingObjectException when necessary, 2017-03-29) aborts the
""have"" walk early to salvage the fetch.  The downside of that change
is that remaining ""have""s are ignored unless they pointed directly to
an object with a bitmap.  In the worst case this can increase the
bandwidth cost of a fetch to the cost of a clone because most ""have""s
are ignored.

Avoid this cost by bypassing the failed ""have"" completely and moving
on to the remaining ""have""s.

Some repository topologies can cause carryOntoHistory to overflow the
thread stack, due to its strategy of recursing into the 2nd+ parents
of a merge commit.  This can easily happen if a project maintains a
local fork, and frequently pulls from the upstream repository, which
itself may have a branchy history.

Rewrite the carryOntoHistory algorithm to use a fixed amount of thread
stack, pushing the save points onto the heap.  By using heap space the
thread stack depth is no longer a concern.  Repositories are instead
limited by available memory.

The algorithm is now structured as two loops:

  carryOntoHistory: This outer loop pops saved commits off the top of
  the stack, allowing the inner loop algorithm to dive down that path
  and carry bits onto commits along that part of the graph.  The loop
  ends when there are no more stack elements.

  carryOntoHistoryInner: The inner loop walks along a single path of
  the graph. For a string of pearls (commits with one parent each)

    r <- s <- t <- u

  the algorithm walks backwards from u to r by iteratively updating
  its local variable 'c'.  This avoids heap allocation along a simple
  path that does not require remembering state.

  The inner loop breaks in the HAVE_ALL case, when all bits have been
  found to be previously set on the commit.  This occurs when a prior
  iteration of the outer loop (carryOntoHistory) explored a different
  path to this same commit, and copied the bits onto it.

  When the inner loop encounters a merge commit, it pushes all parents
  onto the heap based stack by allocating individual CarryStack
  elements for each parent.  Parents are pushed in order, allowing
  side branches to be explored first.

  A small optimization is taken for the last parent, avoiding pushing
  it and instead updating 'c', allowing the side branch to be entered
  without allocating a CarryStack.

CloneCommand.call() has three stages: preparation, then the actual
clone (init/fetch), and finally maybe checking out the working
directory.

Restructure such that if we fail or are cancelled during the actual
clone (middle phase), we do clean up the disk again. This prevents
leaving behind a partial clone in an inconsistent state: either we
have a fully successfully built clone, or nothing at all.

Commit db77610 ensured that all refs/tags are in the primary GC pack.
It did that by adding all of the refs/tags commits to the primary GC
pack PackWriter's ""interesting"" object set.

Unfortunately, all commit objects in the ""interesting"" set are
selected as commits for which bitmap indices will be built. In a
repository like chromium with lots of tags, this changed the number of
bitmaps created from <700 to >10000. That puts huge memory pressure on
the GC task.

This change restores the original behavior of ignoring tags when
performing bitmap index commit selection.

Commits for refs/heads and refs/tags for unannotated tags can not be
differentiated in the ""uninteresting"" objects set. We instead identify
refs/tags commits by passing their ObjectIds as a new ""noBitmaps""
parameter to the PackWriter.preparePack() methods.
PackWriterBitmapPreparer.setupTipCommitBitmaps() can then use that
""noBitmaps"" parameter to exclude those commits.

When a command invoked from readPipe fails to launch (i.e. the exec call fails
due to a missing command executable), Process.start() throws, which gets caught
by the generic IOException handler, resulting in a null return. This change
detects this case and rethrows a CommandFailedException instead.

Additionally, this change uses /bin/sh instead of bash for its posix command
failure test, to accomodate building in environments where bash is unavailable.

When running an automatic GC on a FileRepository, when the caller
passes a NullProgressMonitor, run the GC in a background thread. Use a
thread pool of size 1 to limit the number of background threads spawned
for background gc in the same application. In the next minor release we
can make the thread pool configurable.

In some cases, the auto GC limit is lower than the true number of
unreachable loose objects, so auto GC will run after every (e.g) fetch
operation.  This leads to the appearance of poor fetch performance.
Since these GCs will never make progress (until either the objects
become referenced, or the two week timeout expires), blocking on them
simply reduces throughput.

In the event that an auto GC would make progress, it's still OK if it
runs in the background. The progress will still happen.

This matches the behavior of regular git.

If the user passes a ProgressMonitor that is not a NullProgressMonitor,
they might actually care about the progress of the GC, and would get
confused if that progress happened after the autoGC call returns, so we
run in the foreground in that case.

Git (and now jgit) uses the lock file for gc.log to prevent simultaneous
runs of background gc. Further, it writes errors to gc.log, and won't
run background gc if that file is present and recent. If gc.log is too
old (according to the config gc.logexpiry), it will be ignored.

Ensure the Jsch instance used knows about ~/.ssh/config. This
enables Jsch to honor more user configurations (see
com.jcraft.jsch.Session.applyConfig()), in particular also the
UserKnownHostsFile configuration, or additional identities given
via multiple IdentityFile entries.

Turn JGit's OpenSshConfig into a full parser that can be a
Jsch-compliant ConfigRepository. This avoids a few bugs
in Jsch's OpenSSHConfig and keeps the JGit-facing interface
unchanged. At the same time we can supply a JGit OpenSshConfig
instance as a ConfigRepository to Jsch. And since they'll both
work from the same object, we can also be sure that the parsing
behavior is identical.

The parser does not handle the ""Match"" and ""Include"" keys, and it
doesn't do %-token substitutions (yet).

Note that Jsch doesn't handle multi-valued UserKnownHostFile
entries as known by modern OpenSSH.[1]

Additional tests for new features are provided in OpenSshConfigTest.

be replaced only if specified in the config; if not, it would be the
caller's responsibility to replace them with values obtained from the
URI to connect to.

Jsch doesn't know about token substitutions at all. By doing the
replacements as good as we can in the config file parser, we can
make Jsch support most of these tokens.

%i is not handled at all as Java has no concept of a ""user ID"".

There is at least one git server out there (GOGS) that does
not require authentication on the initial GET for
info/refs?service=git-receive-pack but that _does_ require
authentication for the subsequent POST to actually do the push.

This occurs on GOGS with public repositories; for private
repositories it wants authentication up front.

Handle this behavior by adding 401 handling to our POST request.
Note that this is suboptimal; we'll re-send the push data at
least twice if an authentication failure on POST occurs. It
would be much better if the server required authentication
up-front in the GET request.

Also limit the number of times we'll follow redirects.

Tested successfully with a public repository at try.gogs.io.
That server offers only BASIC auth, so the other paths
(DIGEST, NEGOTIATE) are untested and I have no way to test
them.

This commit implements (1) if there are no pushUris. I did not dare
implement (2) because:

Some downstream code checks whether a ReceiveCommand is a create or an
update based on the type field. Other downstream code (in particular a
good chunk of Gerrit code I write) checks the same thing by comparing
oldId/newId to zeroId. Unfortunately, there were no strict checks in the
constructor that ensures that zeroId is only set for oldId/newId if the
type argument corresponds, so a caller that passed mismatched IDs and
types would observe completely undefined behavior as a result. This is
and always has been a misuse of the API; throw IllegalArgumentException
so the caller knows that it is a misuse.

Similarly, throw from the constructor if oldId/newId are null. The
non-nullness requirement was already documented. Fix RefDirectoryTest to
not do the wrong thing.

Currently there is no way to determine the precise changes done
to the working tree by a JGit command. Only the CheckoutCommand
actually provides access to the lists of modified, deleted, and
to-be-deleted files, but those lists may be inaccurate (since they
are determined up-front before the working tree is modified) if
the actual checkout then fails halfway through. Moreover, other
JGit commands that modify the working tree do not offer any way to
figure out which files were changed.

This poses problems for EGit, which may need to refresh parts of the
Eclipse workspace when JGit has done java.io file operations.

Provide the foundations for better file change tracking: the working
tree is modified exclusively in DirCacheCheckout. Make it emit a new
type of RepositoryEvent that lists all files that were modified or
deleted, even if the checkout failed halfway though.

EGit thus can register a listener for these events and then knows
exactly which parts of the Eclipse workspace may need to be refreshed.

Two commands manage checking out individual DirCacheEntries themselves:
checkout specific paths, and applying a stash with untracked files.
Make those two also emit such a new WorkingTreeModifiedEvent.

The RefDirectory implementation of doDelete never considered whether to
delete a symref or its leaf, because the detachingSymbolicRef bit was
never exposed from RefUpdate. The behavior was thus incorrectly to
always delete the symref, never the leaf.

There was no test for this behavior. The only thing that attempted to be
a test was testDeleteHeadInBareRepo, but this test was broken for
reasons unrelated to this bug. Specifically, it set the leaf to point to
a completely nonexistent object, and then asserted that deleting HEAD
resulted in NO_CHANGE. The only reason this test ever passed is because
of a quirk of updateImpl, which treats a missing object as the same as
null. This quirk aside, the test wasn't really testing the right thing.
Turn this into a real test by writing out a real object and pointing the
leaf at that.

Also, add a test for the detachingSymbolicRef case, i.e. deleting the
symref and leaving the leaf alone.

ReftableReader provides sequential scanning support over all
references, a range of references within a subtree (such as
""refs/heads/""), and lookup of a single reference.  Reads can be
accelerated by an index block, if it was created by the writer.

The BlockSource interface provides an abstraction to read from the
reftable's backing storage, supporting a future commit to connect
to JGit DFS and the DfsBlockCache.

While implementing a custom subclass of DfsStreamKey it became obvious
the required derive(String) was making it impossible to construct an
efficient key in all cases.

Instead, use a special wrapper type ForReverseIndex around the INDEX's
own DfsStreamKey to denote the reverse index stream in the
DfsBlockCache.  This adds a smaller layer of boxing, but eliminates
weird issues for DFS implementors using specialized DfsStreamKey
implementations for space efficiency reasons.

Now that DfsStreamKey is reasonably light-weight, avoid allocating the
index and reverse index keys until necessary.  DfsPackFile mostly
holds the DfsBlockCache.Ref handle to the object, and only needs the
DfsStreamKey when its looking up the handle.

If a repo frequently uses PackedBatchRefUpdates, there is likely to be
contention on the packed-refs file, so it's not appropriate to fail
immediately the first time we fail to acquire a lock. Add some logic to
RefDirectory to support general retrying of lock acquisition.

Currently, there is a hard-coded wait starting at 100ms and backing off
exponentially to 1600ms, for about 3s of total wait. This is no worse
than the hard-coded backoff that JGit does elsewhere, e.g. in
FileUtils#delete. One can imagine a scheme that uses per-repository
configuration of backoff, and the current interface would support this
without changing any callers.

This avoids executing mergeAlgorithm.merge on binary data, which is

Arguably, binary data should not make it to
ResolveMerger#contentMerge, but this approach has the following
advantages:

* binary detection is exact, since it not only looks at the start of
  the blob.

* it is cheap, as we have to iterate over the bytes anyway to find

In a server scenario such as Gerrit Code Review, there may be many
atomic BatchRefUpdates contending for logs on both the packed-refs file
and some subset of loose refs. We already retry lock acquisition to
improve this situation slightly, but we can do better by using an
in-process lock. This way, instead of retrying and potentially exceeding
their timeout, different threads sharing the same Repository instance
can wait on a fair lock without having to touch the disk lock. As a
server is probably already using RepositoryCache anyway, there is a high
likelihood of reusing the Repository instance.

The ReflogWriter constructor just took a Repository and called
getDirectory() on it to figure out the reflog dirs, but not all
Repository instances use this storage format for reflogs, so it's
incorrect to attempt to use ReflogWriter when there is not a
RefDirectory directly involved. In practice, ReflogWriter was mostly
only used by the implementation of RefDirectory, so enforcing this is
mostly just shuffling around calls in the same internal package.

The one exception is StashDropCommand, which writes to a reflog lock
file directly. This was a reasonable implementation decision, because
there is no general reflog interface in JGit beyond using
(Batch)RefUpdate to write new entries to the reflog. So to implement
""git stash drop <N>"", which removes an arbitrary element from the
reflog, it's fair to fall back to the RefDirectory implementation.
Creating and using a more general interface is well beyond the scope of
this change.

That said, the old behavior of writing out the reflog file even if
that's not the reflog format used by the given Repository is clearly
wrong. Fail fast in this case instead.

When creating a new PackFile instance it is specified whether this pack
has an associated bitmap index file or not. This information is cached
and the public method getBitmapIndex() will always assume a bitmap index
file must exist if the cached data tells so. But it may happen that the
packfiles are repacked during a gc in a different process causing the
packfile,bitmap-index and index file to be deleted. Since JGit still has
an open FileHandle on the packfile this file is not really deleted and
can still be accessed. But index and bitmap index file are deleted.
Modify getBitmapIndex() to be aware of such a situation in invalidate
the packfile instance if such a situation occurs.

This problem showed up when a gerrit server was serving repositories
which where garbage collected with native git regularly. Fetches and
clones for certain repositories failed permanently after a native git gc
was deleting old bitmap index files.

Some repositories can have a policy that do not accept certain blobs. To
check if the incoming pack file contains such blobs, ObjectChecker can
be used. However, this ObjectChecker is not called by PackParser if the
blob is stored as a whole. This is because the object can be so large
that it doesn't fit in memory.

This change introduces BlobObjectChecker. This interface takes chunks of
a blob instead of the entire object. ObjectChecker can optionally return
a BlobObjectChecker. This won't change existing ObjectChecker
implementation; existing implementation continues to receive deltified
blob objects only.

Path pattern matching for attribute rules is different than matching
for excluded files.

The first difference concerns patterns without slashes. For
gitattributes those must match on the last component only, not on
any earlier segment.

The second difference is that directory-only patterns never match
since gitattributes deals only with files. This is also true if the
pattern would match a prefix or a containing directory.

And third, matches only on a prefix must match for gitattributes
only if the last matcher was ""/**"".

Add a new parameter for such path matching to IMatcher.matches() and
pass it through as appropriate (false for gitignore, true for
gitattributes). As far as gitignore is concerned, there is no change.

New tests have been added, and some existing attribute matching tests
have been fixed since they operated on wrong assumptions.

To validate that this interpretation is actually correct, new tests
that verify that JGit matches the same as C git have been added, for
both attribute matching (.gitattributes) and file exclusion matching
(.gitignore). These tests work by setting up a test repository and
test rules, and then determine excluded files or attributes both with
JGit and with the native C git, and then compare the results.

For .gitignore tests, we run

  git ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard -o
  
and for attribute tests we use

  git check-attr --stdin --all
  
and pass the list of all files in the repository via stdin.

Make the handling of typed values somewhat configurable by using
a separate converter. The default converter is the same as before;
just the implementations of the getters were moved. They also still
raise IllegalArgumentException on invalid values as before.

The converter can be set globally via Config.setTypedConfigGetter(),
which EGit can use in its core Activator to plug in a variant that
catches the IllegalArgumentException, logs the problem, and then
returns the default value.

In this way the behavior for other users of the JGit library is
unchanged, while EGit can deal gracefully with invalid git configs.

DfsReftableDatabase is a new alternative for DfsRefDatabase that
handles more operations for the implementor by delegating through
reftable. All reftable files are stored in sibling DfsObjDatabase
using PackExt.REFTABLE and PackSource.INSERT.

Its assumed the DfsObjDatabase periodically runs compactions and GCs
using DfsPackCompactor and DfsGarbageCollector.  Those passes are
essential to collapsing the stack of reftables.

Add an update_index to every reference in a reftable, storing the
exact transaction that last modified the reference.  This is necessary
to fix some merge race conditions.

Consider updates at T1, T3 are present in two reftables.  Compacting
these will create a table with range [T1,T3].  If T2 arrives during
or after the compaction its impossible for readers to know how to
merge the [T1,T3] table with the T2 table.

With an explicit update_index per reference, MergedReftable is able to
individually sort each reference, merging individual entries at T3
from [T1,T3] ahead of identically named entries appearing in T2.

Doing so goes through the TypedConfigGetter and thus allows library
clients (for instance EGit) to warn about invalid configurations.

Note that the handling of submodule.*.ignore appears to be broken
in JGit in several respects:

1. According to [1], the value in .gitmodules can be overridden
   in $GIT_DIR/config, which in turn can be overridden on the command
   line. These overrides are not implemented in JGit.
   
2. IndexDiff appears to handle the setting incorrectly. See lines
   IndexDiff.java, lines 526ff. First, it overrides the command-line
   setting (field IndexDiff.ignoreSubmoduleMode) with the per-submodule
   setting from .gitmodules iff it is ""ALL"". Second, it loads that
   config value only on the first submodule, but then applies it to
   all remaining submodules encountered.

These bugs are _not_ fixed by this commit.

Hence revert the save action ""Convert control statement bodies to
blocks"" which would affect a large number of code lines not affected by
the change editing some small part of a class. This would generate a
large number of changes which may lead to many unnecessary conflicts.
Total number of affected lines across jgit would be around 10k lines.

Also revert ""Remove unused imports"" since it erroneously removes imports
of some annotations needed by pgm classes using args4j.

Move the connectivity check into its own helper method.  This moves it
left one level of identation, and makes it easier to fit the method's

Don't convert a lot of ObjectId to String stored in generic

Instead rely on ""this"" from the FsckPackParser to lookup information
about the objects in this pack file, which lets the verify code avoid
sorting the object list.

Use ObjectIdOwnerMap, which is the most efficient format JGit has
for storing lots of objects.

Git has a rather elaborate mechanism to specify HTTP configuration
options per URL, based pattern matching the URL against ""http""
subsection names.[1] The URLs used for this matching are always the
original URIs; redirected URLs do not participate.

Implement this for JGit. Factor out the HttpConfig from TransportHttp
and implement the matching and override mechanism.

The set of supported settings is still the same; JGit currently
supports only followRedirects, postBuffer, and sslVerify, plus the
JGit-specific maxRedirects key.

Add tests for path normalization and prefix matching only on segment
separators, and use the new mechanism in SmartClientSmartServerSslTest
to disable sslVerify selectively for only the test server URLs.

Compare also bug 374703 and bug 465492. With this commit it would be
possible to set sslVerify to false for only the git server using a
self-signed certificate instead of having to switch it off globally
via http.sslVerify.

Some tests call out to external cgit. Those tests all failed for me
locally on Mac. Turned out that the reason was that the system git
config used by the git in the bazel run contained paths with ~/ but
somehow $HOME was not set. As a result the external git returned
with exit code 128.

Fix this by passing along $HOME explicitly. Also improve assertions
to make sure we do get the stderr of the external command in the
test log.

I hadn't noticed that until now because apparently the maven build
does pass along $HOME.

When a https connection could not be established because the SSL
handshake was unsuccessful, TransportHttp would unconditionally
throw a TransportException.

Other https clients like web browsers or also some SVN clients
handle this more gracefully. If there's a problem with the server
certificate, they inform the user and give him a possibility to
connect to the server all the same.

In git, this would correspond to dynamically setting http.sslVerify
to false for the server.

Implement this using the CredentialsProvider to inform and ask the
user. We offer three choices:

1. trust the server for the current git operation, or
2. trust the server always from now on for requests originating from
   the current repository, or
3. always trust the server from now on.

For (1), we just suppress SSL verification for the current instance of
TransportHttp.

For (2), we store a http.<uri>.sslVerify = false setting for the
original URI in the repo config.

For (3), we store the http.<uri>.sslVerify setting in the git user
config.

Adapt the SmartClientSmartServerSslTest such that it uses this
mechanism instead of setting http.sslVerify up front.

With atomic ref updates using packed refs, JGit did not fire a
RefsChangedEvent. This resulted in a user-visible regression in
EGit: the UI would not update after a ""Fetch from upstream..."".
Presumably it would also make Gerrit miss out on ref changes?

Strengthen the BatchRefUpdateTest by also asserting the expected
number of RefsChangedEvents, and ensure modCnt is incremented in
RefDirectory.commitPackedRefs() when refs really changed (as opposed
to some internal housekeeping operation, such as packing loose refs).

An application can choose to invoke setAdvertisedRefs multiple times,
for example several AdvertiseRefsHook installed in a chain. Each of
these invocations populates the advertisedHaves collection with the
unique set of ObjectIds.

This can lead to a server over-advertising with "".have"" lines if the
first hook pushes in a lot of references, and the second hook filters
this to a subset.  ReceivePack will advertise the unique objects from
the first hook using "".have"" lines, which may lead to a huge
advertisement sent to the client.

This can also contribute to a very slow connetivity check after the
pack is parsed as ReceivePack calls markUninteresting on every commit
in advertisedHaves.  This may require expanding a lot of subtrees to
mark all trees as uninteresting as well.  On a very big repository
this can lead to a many-second stall.

Clear the advertisedHaves collection anytime the refs are updated.
Add a test to verify the correct set of objects was sent.

Same problem as in commit c227268: openUserConfig() just creates the

load() is needed.

As HttpConfig is read-only this omission did not cause any bad effects,
but it simply ignored values from the user config. Most uses of
HttpConfig go through the two-argument constructor, though, where
HttpConfig is given an already loaded repo config.

Do tilde replacement for values from the ssh config file that are
file names in all cases to make sure that they are already replaced
when Jsch tries to get the values.

Previously, OpenSshConfig did tilde replacement only for the
IdentityFile in the JGit-facing ""Host"" interface and left the
replacement in the Jsch-facing ""Config"" interface to Jsch.

But on Windows the JGit notion of what should be used to replace the
tilde differs from Jsch's replacement. Jsch always replaces the tilde
by the value of the system property ""user.home"", whereas JGit also
considers some environment variables like %HOME%. This can lead to
rather surprising failures as in the case of bug 526175 where
%HOME% != user.home.

Prior to commit 9d24470 (i.e.,prior to JGit 4.9.0) this problem never
occurred because Jsch was completely unaware of the ssh config file
and all host and IdentityFile handling happened exclusively in JGit.

So far we follow OSGi semantic versioning [1] which says the following:

""A change in the second (minor) part of the version signals that the
change is backward compatible with consumers of the API package but not
with the providers of that API. That is, when the API package goes from
version 1.5 to 1.6 it is no longer compatible with a provider of that
API but consumers of that API are backward compatible with that API
package.""

The change Ib5fbf17bdaf727bc5d0e106ce88f2620d9f87a6f broke EMF Compare
which subclasses ResolveMerger since we added a new parameter to the
protected ResolveMerger.processEntry() method. According to the above
cited OSGi semantic versioning this is ok, implementers should expect
that they break on minor version changes of the API they implement.

This change reintroduces the old processEntry() method in order to help
avoid breakage for existing EMF Compare versions which expect breakage
also for the implementer case only for major version change (in this
case from JGit 4.x to 5.x).

GC explicitly handles the case where a new pack has the same name as an
existing pack due to it containing the exact same set of objects. In
this case, the pack passed to insertPack will have the same name as an
existing pack, but it will also almost certainly have a later mtime than
the existing pack.

The loop in insertPack tried to short-circuit when inserting a new pack,
to avoid walking more of the pack list than necessary. Unfortunately,
this means it will never get to the check for an identical name,
resulting in a duplicate entry for the same PackFile in the pack list.
Remove the short-circuit so that insertPack does not insert a duplicate
entry.

Applications that use ObjectInserters to create lots of individual
objects may prefer to avoid cluttering up the object directory with
loose objects. Add a specialized inserter implementation that produces a
single pack file no matter how many objects. This inserter is loosely
based on the existing DfsInserter implementation, but is simpler since
we don't need to buffer blocks in memory before writing to storage.

An alternative for such applications would be to write out the loose
objects and then repack just those objects later. This operation is not
currently supported with the GC class, which always repacks existing
packs when compacting loose objects. This in turn requires more
CPU-intensive reachability checks and extra I/O to copy objects from old
packs to new packs.

So, the choice was between implementing a new variant of repack, or not
writing loose objects in the first place. The latter approach is likely
less code overall, and avoids unnecessary I/O at runtime.

The current implementation does not yet support newReader() for reading
back objects.

When a GC operation is interrupted, temporary packs and indexes can be
left on the pack folder. In big, busy repositories this can lead to
significant amounts of wasted disk space if this interruption is done
with a certain frequency.

Remove stale temporary packs and objects at the end of the GC process so
they do not accumulate.

Currently, unless RequestPolicy#ANY is used, UploadPack rejects all
non-commit ""want"" lines unless they were advertized. This is fine,
except when ""uploadpack.allowreachablesha1inwant"" is true
(corresponding to RequestPolicy#REACHABLE_COMMIT), in which case one
would expect that ""want""-ing anything reachable would work.

(There is no restriction that ""want"" lines must only contain commits -
it is allowed for refs to directly point to trees and blobs, and
requesting for them using ""want"" lines works.)

This commit has been written to avoid performance regressions as much
as possible. In the usual (and currently working) case where the only
unadvertized things requested are commits, we do a standard RevWalk in
order to avoid incurring the cost of loading bitmaps. However, if
unadvertized non-commits are requested, bitmaps are used instead, and
if there are no bitmaps, a WantNotValidException is thrown (as is
currently done).

JSch unconditionally overrides the user name given in the connection
URI by the one found in ~/.ssh/config (if that does specify one for
the used host). If the SSH config file has a different user name,
we'll end up using the wrong name, which typically results in an
authentication failure or in Eclipse/EGit asking for a password for
the wrong user.

Unfortunately there is no way to prevent or circumvent this Jsch
behavior up front; it occurs already in the Session constructor at
com.jcraft.jsch.Session() and the Session.applyConfig() method. And
while there is a Session.setUserName() that would enable us to correct
this, that latter method has package visibility only.

So resort to reflection to invoke that setUserName() method to ensure
that Jsch uses the user name from the URI, if there is one.

Jsch 0.1.54 passes on the values from ~/.ssh/config for
""ServerAliveInterval"" and ""ConnectTimeout"" as read from
the config file to java.net.Socket.setSoTimeout(). That
method expects milliseconds, but the values in the config
file are seconds!

The missing conversion in Jsch means that the timeout is
set way too low, and if the server doesn't respond within
that very short time frame, Jsch kills the connection and
then throws an exception with a message such as ""session is
down"" or ""timeout in waiting for rekeying process"".

As a work-around, do the conversion to milliseconds in the
Jsch-facing Config interface of OpenSshConfig. That way Jsch
already gets these values as milliseconds.

Then list of packed refs was cached in RefDirectory based on mtime of
the packed-refs file. This may fail on NFS when attributes are cached.
A cached mtime of the packed-refs file could cause JGit to trust the
cached content of this file and to overlook that the file is modified.

Honor the config option trustFolderStats and always read the packed-refs
content if the option is false. By default this option is set to true
and this fix is not active.

When running on NFS there was a chance that JGits LockFile
semantic is broken because File#createNewFile() may allow
multiple clients to create the same file in parallel. This
change provides a fix which is only used when the new config
option core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile is set to false. The
default for this option is true.

If the config option core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile is true
then File#createNewFile() is trusted and the behaviour doesn't
change.

But if core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile is set to false then after
successful creation of the lock file a hardlink to that lock file is
created and the attribute nlink of the lock file is checked to be 2. If
multiple clients manage to create the same lock file nlink would be
greater than 2 showing the error.

This expensive workaround is described in
 https://www.time-travellers.org/shane/papers/NFS_considered_harmful.html
section III.d) ""Exclusive File Creation""

The index header consist of a 4-byte version number. The current
supported version numbers are 2 and 3. The code checks if any entries
are extended. If it find any entries that are extended if picks version
'3', otherwise it chooses version '2'.


DirCache.java
-Changed the 'extended' check to exit early when any entry is considered
'extended' in the index.

(Of course, I maybe missing a bitwise optimization that the is made in
the Java bytecode.)

There is no point in calling back to the RemoteReader to resolve a
40-digit hex SHA-1 to itself.  We already skip that call when not
ignoring remote failures; skip it when ignoring remote failures, too.

This should simplify RemoteReader implementations.
