The cause of the Exception was that the value of the ""property""
attribute of the test element was wrong. The method ""testProperty""
of org.eclipse.core.internal.propertytester.ResourcePropertyTester
takes both the property name and the property value from the ""args""
argument.  The value of the attribute ""property"" is used to determine
the type of the property.

The EGit UI behaviour is the same as before, but without the
exception in the Error log and with a cleaner plugin.xml.

user

ConnectProviderOperation tries to connect only projects provided by
getProjects() method in ExistingOrNewPage. This method returns a list of
projects. But a mapping between project and git repository directory is
never used and lost.

Then it tries to find repository by himself using RepositoryFinder's
method find(IProgressMonitor). Logic of this method was fixed and it
returns more then one RepositoryMapping for a project nested into other
git repository. But this isn't expected by ConnectProviderOperation and
it wouldn't even try to connect such project.

Now it's fixed:
- method getProjects() in ExistingOrNewPage returns Map<IProject, File>
  instead of IProject[]. It provides information about git repositories
  which has been selected by user for each project. If a git repository
  path is absolute (it was just created) it will make it relative to the
  project's root.
- ConnectProviderOperation uses Map<IProject, File> instead of IProject[]
  and will connect project to git repository only if it has been founded
  in repository mappings provided by method find(IProgressMonitor) for a
  given project.

If this environment variable is set it will be interpreted as a list
of directories above which which the Git Team Provider does not search
for repositories.

The key here is ""search"". By explicitly pointing at a repository it can
still be used, regardless of where it is located.

This feature is mostly useful for testing, but can possibly be used to cut
of scans into network directories, which is the original rationale for the
implementation in C Git.

Workaround for https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/TYCHO-168

Removed checkNotNested. Conventional maven project layout results in the following
repository nesting

parallelip-egit <= egit source tree root
  /.git
  /org.eclipse.egit.core.test
    /target
      /work
        /data <= test workspace
          /.git
          /.metadata
          /Project-1

Disable checkNotNested as a short term solution, but in the long term we need to
reintroduce this check with mechanisms like Git's GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES to make
sure it does not produce false positive during maven build.

This is about cleaning up the anti-pattern
of constructing an Exception in a utility
method and throwing it in the code. This
will result in wrong stack traces (found
both in EGit Core and EGit UI).

Furthermore, a couple of methods were
placed in the classes that need them instead
of having them in the plug-in activator (only in
EGit UI).

A few places were marked as TODO where
an error status is created but neither logged
nor thrown as CoreException.

Instead the ID of the plug-in that is

It is bad form to prompt the user with an error message before
they have actually entered any data. The input validator for
the branch naming text field is too aggressive with its warning.
It should only prompt when the user has actually entered data

FetchResultTable and PushResultTable was originally using JFace's
ColorRegistry for allocating its Color instances. The ColorRegistry
will dispose of its Colors when its owning Display is disposed. In
the case of the Eclipse workbench, the Display will only ever be
disposed when Eclipse itself shuts down.

Since the tables create new registries every time they are created,
a Color instance is leaked for every request that is made to the
registry. The code has been corrected to simply instantiate new,
local Color instances directly which are now disposed when the
table widget is disposed.

so editors can be reused

When editors are asked to be opened in the Eclipse workbench, the
default behaviour is to simply activate an existing editor if an
existing editor shares the input with the input that is to be
opened. The contract for comparing editor inputs is via the
equals(Object) method. For a FileRevisionEditorInput, this
is implemented by checking the equality between the two inputs'
underlying file revisions. As such, CommitFileRevision should 
implement equals(Object) (and hashCode() for consistency) so that
the same editor can be reused instead of having multiple editors
open on a given revision.

The view's code was arbitrarily introducing a TreeColumn to the
view's tree which had a width of 700. This meant that when the
view's width became less than 700, it would have to show scroll
bars to accomodate for this. However, it should actually only be
showing scroll bars if it has to and not because of some arbitrary
value has been surpassed.

The worst part is that using columns means that the text can only
go as far as what is dictated by its width. Since the view does not
have any column headers displayed, the user actually has no way of
resizing the column to view all of the content. The fix is to just
not use any columns and to let the tree itself determine whether it
needs to show scroll bars or not based on whether it is currently
displaying content that exceeds its own width.

Replace IWorkspaceRunnable in EGit operations (e.g. BranchOperation)
by a new interface IEGitOperation.
BranchOperation now uses a workspace runnable to lock the workspace
while the working tree is modified.
BranchAction executes BranchOperation in a Job. The other actions
will be adopted to this execution pattern in further commits.

This change will break the build of EGit if this JGit change is not merged.
On the other hand: As soon as the JGit change has been merged we'll have to
merge this change soon.

set every time, those menus that have been replaced are now lying
around and will only be disposed when the shell itself is disposed.

EGit Tycho builds on build.eclipse.org frequently hit corrupted artifacts
which leads to broken builds. Cleaning up these corrupted files is tedious
since it requires file system access on the build server. Hence we want to
switch to use job-local m2 repositories. This requires that build artifacts
are shared between the jgit and egit build jobs via p2. Therefore we switch
from pom-first to p2 build dependencies between the egit and the jgit build.

For local builds the egit build assumes that jgit and egit are located
under a common parent folder. If this is not the case the URL of the jgit
update site has to be injected via system property ""jgit-site"".

- non-default local build:
$ mvn clean install -Djgit-site=file:/path/to/org.eclipse.jgit.updatesite/target/site

The current implementation of UIText.java has the bundle name
inlined. Unfortunately, this results in the ""Source->Find Broken Externalized
String"" workbench action to not find any unused or otherwise inconsistent
keys (an info dialog is displayed saying ""No NLS properties files found..."".
This fix does not actually fix inconsistencies in the externalized Strings, just
enables the tool to find such inconsistencies (there are currently 42 unused keys
in the UIText.java).

The SharingWizardTest did not work in the maven build.
The test assumes that no git repository is found above
the test project. When the junit-workspace was located
inside a git repository this condition was not fulfilled.

This is fixed using a MockSystemReader and a
ceiling directory.

If the user has copied a clipboard already, then we can access that
from the SWT clipboard. If it looks like a transport we know about
(as reported by Transport.canHandleProtocol) then we pre-fill the
connection dialog with that as the URI.

Since we need to fill in the user/port combinations, refactor out
the code which does this on keypress and instead call that function,
but only once, and only after all the fields have been created.

Operations performing a work dir checkout (e.g. branch, reset)
may delete .project files. This leads to inconsistent projects
causing follow-up problems. This fix deletes projects that got
inconsistent by the work dir checkout.

Problem example:

Project p exists in branch b1.
.project file of project p is contained in the Git repository.
Project p does not exist in branch b2.
Active branch is b1.
Checkout branch b2. This removes the .project file of p.
Branch operation fails because refreshing p fails.
The workspace now contains a project with missing .project file.

Some time later the DelayedSnapshotJob (Workspace Auto-save) restores the
.project file.

Switching back to branch b1 fails with a checkout conflict:
workdir checkout can not be done because there is an untracked .project file 
in the working directory.

This occurs because these menu actions are implemented
using a preference change listener. When the page is disposed,
the corresponding actions are not disposed by the history framework,
so the registered actions keep listening for the preference changes.
To reproduce, open a Git History, then open ""History"" on some non-
Git controlled object in order to dispose the page. Open again a Git
History page, then click on the view menu -> Wrap comments (or any
other action there).
The fix actively disposes the registered actions when the page is disposed.

configuration is stored (e.g. ""2 k"" for window size), then start-up of

Furthermore, no suitable error message is shown when this value

The fix makes the startup failsafe by logging an error if the config
is wrong but starting the cache with the default config. Also, the
preference page shows an error message if a wrong value is

Remote configuration handling in the Git Repositories view must
behave like the standard: it is possible to push to a remote repository
if only a ""url"" is present in the config, but no ""pushurl"". If both
url and pushurl exist, they are all used.
Accordingly, the ""configure push"" UI must show the (fetch-) URL
if it is present and make addition of ""pushurl""s optional in this case.
Also the Repo View content provider had to be adjusted in order to
show the ""push"" node if only a ""url"" and a ""push"" but no ""pushurl""
is defined.

The bug describes a specific problem which was occurring
in different wizards due to their implemenation using
some event mechanism to notify the ""next"" wizard page
of URI changes. This has been removed and the ""next""
wizard page is notified about the URI by overriding the
setVisible() method and setting the current URI just
before the page opens.
This pattern has been applied for all affected pages.
It also helps in decoupling the different wizard
pages by removing hard-coded usages between them.
As for the specific bug, we may need some other
improvements depending on whether URI validation on
the RepositorySelectionPage is needed. This could for
example be added as a ""Validate URI"" button or such.

Some UI tests were broken because their
sequence has changed and thus some
user preferences that were changed no
longer have their default values as expected
by some other tests.
Furthermore, the ""delay"" being set by a static
method in one of the test base classes got
lost due to this change (whether this parameter
is effective depends on the sequence of class loading,
so it is not reliable), and the delay was
removed altogether and some Thread.sleep()
calls or local refresh calls were added where
needed. This resulted in much faster execution.
In order to allow delayed replay, a specific
launch config was checked in.
Finally, one test was broken to to productive code
changes.

With the advent of merge capabilities, we should
make the repository state (mostly merge, rebase)
 visible in the Git label decorationsfor projects.
Instead of adding another tag, we re-use the
""repository name"" tag and append the repository state separated by 
a pipe similar to the behavior in msysgit. 
This allows to elegantly treat the ""SAFE"" state that we don't
want to show explicitly: we just add nothing to the repository name.
This avoids ugly formatting issues which we would run into
if using a separate tag: unless we would want to always show
the state (even if it is SAFE) we would introduce ugly spaces
into the label decoration in case the state is SAFE (and thus the
displayed value is null or an empty String). The alternative of howing 
the state always does not appear to be the right thing, either, as it
would pollute the label decoration with un-needed information in the
99 percent case.

On GTK, the default behavior is to show the cancel button before the OK button in
all dialogs. In the tests we should not assume the order of the buttons but try
to match by the button text. In order to run the tests on GTK, it is neccessary to identify
the right button as all tests currently ""click"" the Cancel button when trying to
open the Repository View.

While writing tests for EGit Core, the following problems with
PushOperation were identified: 
1. an operation result is returned even if the operation was not run before
2. when re-using he specification used to create the operation, the
operation result is completely wrong (says UP_TO_DATE and does
not update the remote repo even if it should)
These issues were fixed and corresponding tests
were added. 

Other tests for the 

1. ListRemoteOperation
2. TagOperation
3. TrackOperation
4. UntrackOperation
5. DiscardChangesOperation

were added along with some infrastructure for these
tests (which need to set up two repositories instead of just
one).

There were also some intermittent failures to delete resources
in GitResourceVariant* and BlotStorage tests. Hopfully the change there
will improve this.

Total test coverage for egit core improves from around 34 percent to around 51 percent.

Add some UI tests for the following Team-> menu actions:

Also added memory settings for extended PermGen to

after the commit to have a time gap between commit and file change

When we have a .project file, we should always create the project
metainformation based on this file. I don't see any reason to use
the file path to determinate the project name. In addition,
Platform.getLocation has nothing to do with the workspace but rather
the working directory of the platform. Also refactored the ProjectRecord
a little bit to simplify it. This also fixes bug 314035 to use the project
name of the .project file.

In Git synchronization we always operate on commit level changes
therefore source and destination points should be always RevCommit
objects. In case of synchronizing tags we should map given tag with
proper RevCommit object. Instead of doing this multiple times on
different levels I've add this resolution to GitSynchronizeData
constructor.

This change is intended as first step to imporove the usabily of the
Git History View. From the end user perspective, the following changes
are noticeable:

1. there is a new toolbar button ""Show all versions for the resource""
which makes the ""resource mode"" explicit (in other words, we now have
four radio buttons insted of three where selection of no button at all
would represent the fourth option)
2. ""Wrap comments"" and ""Fill paragraphs"" is only available when the context menu
is opened on the comment viewer
3. The file-specific menu entries (compare, open) were promoted to the top of the context
menu if a file is selected

Internally, all the ""popupMenu"" contributions were removed and replaced
with command contributions and the corresponding actions were refactored out
of the GitHistoryView class into handlers in order to improve maintainability.

Initially we always refreshed when the repository changed, but users
we not happy, so we tied it to the workspace refresh option. This means
Eclipse performs unnecessary work by periodically scanning all recources
as well as scanning when Git refs or index change.

This patch allows Eclipse to rescan only when the refs or index change.
Eclipse still scans some of the repository meta data, but that is a lot
fewer files.

In addition the default is to only scan for repositirt changes or refresh
resources when Eclipse has an active Windows, which means that you can
perform Git operations outside of Eclipse with no (or at least less)
interaction between Eclipse and C Git. This used to be a big problem
for Windows users performing rebase operations.

Ugly enough, it forces a hide/activate cycle on the

This will enable the selection provider correctly.
This can only be done on the Team->Show History

When 'true' is returned in performOk(), the preference dialog will
be closed. We do not want this to happen if an error occurs during a
failed save attempt so we should return 'false' in the face of
errors and invoke (and return) super.performOk() only if the
configuration was saved successfully. performApply()'s default
implementation is to invoke performOk() so there is no reason to
perform a save separately in performApply(). Due to the chaining of
method calls, the current implementation ends up saving the
configuration twice.

The superclass's implementation of okPressed() will close the dialog
so we want to make the same general changes so that the dialog will
only be closed if the save completes successfully.

because the icon is already there, just the right usage in the label
provider was missing.

It appears that commit 48b45f with was fixing bug 322732 was only
workaround. In previous implementation of
GitModelRepository.getChildrenImpl() we were using LogCommand to
calculate complete list of commits between to given points.
LogCommand.addRange(AnyObjectId, AnyObjectId) internally calls
RevWalk.markUnimportant(RevCommit) on first given AnyObjectId to
addRange() method. RevWalk implementation disposes commits that was
marked as unimportant when traversal has finish. Because we were joining
results of two LogCommands (since common ancestor to destination and
since ancestor to source) the common ancestor commit was included in
commits list but it was disposed by RevWalk, therefore we got an NPE
while launching Compare view. Current implementation of
GitModelRepository.getChildrenImpl() uses single RevWalk instance and
don't mark any commit as unimportant therefore it is free from NPE in
CommitFileRevision.

Similar to the package explorer which supports flat vs. hierarchical
package representation, this allows to toggle between flat vs. hierarchical
branch representation. If the toggle is on, then the ""/"" used in the 
branch names is interpreted as hierarchy separator and the branches are
presented correspondingly.
Other than the suggestion in bug 315567, this does not eliminate the
""Remote Branches"" node altogether in ""hierarchical"" mode, since 
there might be remote branches without ""/"" separators 
which would result in a confusing representation.

This can be very helpful in situations where we can't debug.
Unfortunately, there is no generic UI to do this,
so this adds a preference page to show the existing trace locations for
the EGit UI and EGit Core plug-ins and allows to activate them.
This page is generic enough to be easily extended to include the 
locations of other plug-ins as long as they use an .options file to declare
the locations (and don't do anything else in this .options file).

The behavior of the history view is quite confusing for most users:
instead of showing the current input, a combination of input and
the currently checked button is displayed above the list. Not only
does the user have a hard time to understand what they are seeing
and why they have certain context menus available at a given time,
but also when the ""Repository"" button is selected, the repository name
is always shown as input, no matter where you click. Subsequently,
the navigation history will contain the same String several times, and
you don't see what you have in fact visited.
This change replaces does replace the current String with something
like ""File: MyProject/folder/File.txt [myRepository]"", or
""Project: MyProject [myRepository]"" etc.
The getDescription() method was also changed to return something
like the above appended with a description of the current ""filter"" setting,
for example ""All changes in Repository of this Resource"" or ""All changes
of this Resource"", but unfortunately, this information is never rendered
(the javadoc says it might be rendered as tooltip or such)... I think I'll
open a bug for this one....
This also fixes some missing mnemonics in the view menu.

The main reason of not displaying synchronization data for two remote
branches was that GitResourceVariantTreeComparator was using standard
SyncInfo class. With uses local file to determinate change kind.

The new GitSyncInfo is looking for a first diff for given file in given
range of commits. Based on this it determinate change kind and
direction.

Now we can display differences between two remote branches also in
ChangeSet and in normal synchronization mode.

Currently, the hierarchical branch layout wrongly includes symbolic
Refs, resulting in duplicate entries if the hierarchical branch layout
is active; for example, if there is a Ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD pointing
to refs/remotes/origin/master, then in the hierarchical branch layout
the ""master"" branch will appear twice:

Remote Branches
  origin
  		master
  		master
 
The fix filters out symbolic Refs during child calculation.

Since now we can use also Workspace model presentation when user launch

are able to show user proper data in Compare view.

This improves UI responsiveness of the CreateTagDialog by filling the
""Existing Tags"" list asynchronously and by filling the ""Commit"" combo
box lazily when opening the ""Advanced"" section.
While the tag list is filled, a ""Loading..."" node is shown instead and the
list is inactive. Still it is possible to use the dialog while the list is filled.
In addition, the content provider for the tag list was changed to a simple
ArrayContentProvider which saves some extra overhead.

Enable Team->Show in History on a multi-selection of Resources. The
selected resources will be used as filder for the history view.
This does NOT work for the generic Show In->History action; also, if
""Link with current selection"" is on, this will always work for the last
clicked resource. The latter limitations are due to a shortcoming of the
history framework.

Repository of the selected resources is in state ""Merging"". When
selected, a dialog will appear to ask the user whether they want to
use the workspace (pre-merged) or HEAD (un-merged) version of
the files as input for the merge editor.
The selected files will be shown in the upper part of the editor (only
such files who have conflicts or whose content differs between the
workspace and HEAD version). On double-click, the actual merge editor
will be shown. The user can now edit the left part and save the changed
content to the workspace. With next/previous they can navigate to the
next/previous conflict/change (even across file boundaries).

When displaying refs which are inconsistent (e.g. a MERGE_HEAD

are not even displaying the good refs anymore. By replacing
certain ""objectId.name()"" by ""ObjectId.toString(objectId)""
we can get rid of this problem easily.

With 82ad8027cc039abe7de878110b562ca6ee97e2c9, a bug was
introduced that results in the commit-ID being shown for each

This fixes that bug and also optimizes performance for the label provider
somewhat by avoiding unnecessary calls to getSimpleText().

The UI tests loop on Mac OS X showing tons of

requiring the UI event loop to run on thread 0.
Fix this problem by setting JVM parameter
-XstartOnFirstThread on Mac. This is also done by
Eclipse when defining a SWTBot run configuration.

When selecting a project in the project explorer and then changing

reason is that the repository relative path is not calculated
correctly and subsequently the commit list is always empty which in
turn is something the logic that updates the UI is not prepared to
deal with.

This is a first implementation of Rebase. Users can select a branch in
the Repositories View and have a menu item ""Rebase"". The currently
checked out branch will be rebased onto the selected branch.
If no branch is currently checked out, the menu action will not be
available.

In case of merge conflicts, the rebase will be aborted, i.e. the
original HEAD will be restored and the user will receive an error
pop-up. This is because we found several problems if the repository is
left in state ""merging:
1. It is not possible to resolve the conflicts using ""add"", so the
user can not continue with the rebase (in the command line), no matter
whether they ""add"" in EGit or in the command line.
2. There are some issues when ""aborting"" with the command line a
rebase that was started with EGit: HEAD is restored to the
wrong branch (i.e. the target branch)

These issues will be fixed in subsequent changes.

The 'Git Repositories' view has listeners for monitoring changes to
the list of repositories that should be displayed. This listener is
triggered during the repository removal operation so it is not
necessary for the operation to explicitly request that the view
refresh itself.

The problem here is that createMainPanel(Composite) was arbitrarily
changing the parent composite's layout. This composite was passed in
by the framework and its layout should not be modified. By changing
its layout to become a StackLayout, the framework was no longer able
to interchange the contents of the view between the different
subclasses of HistoryPage.

The fix is to create a new top level composite that will contain all
the controls that the GitHistoryPage needs in addition to the layout
necessary for the EGit implementation to change what it wants to be
visible to the end user at a given moment in time.

When a file has the flag ""assume-unchanged"" it should per default not

In native git commit -a does not commit such files, commit -- <path>
however does. The pre-selection in the commit dialog contains the list
of files which are committed with commit -a, filtered by the selection
in the Package Explorer. Therefore the file with the flag
""assume-unchanged"" should not be pre-selected in the commit dialog.

Originally, the remove command tries to delete first the working
directory (if repository has one) and then the metadata directory.
However the metadata directory could be contained by the working
directory and thus already deleted when the second deletion is called.
In this case an IOException will be thrown, to indicate that the
metadata directory could not be deleted. The correction simply checks
that the metadata directory exists before trying to delete it.

The commit operation as used from the commit dialog did not delete
trees when they became empty. Today Git does not leave empty trees,
it is not intended here and the user certainly does not expect it.

We also add a testcase for this, though the tests for the CommitOperation
lack a lot in general as the logic is not tested anywhere else. Moving
to DirCache will probably reduce the number of needed tests at this
place.

to build.

This is a dialog asking the user to confirm/edit their name and 
e-mail once. This allows them to overwrite the system defaults and
store these values in the user-scoped configuration file.
The dialog will only appear once unless the user explicitly deselects
the ""Do not show again"" check box.
The information that the dialog was already shown is stored as a
Preference in the workspace. It is also possible to open the 
user-scoped Git configuration from this dialog to do more
configuration there.
Since there is no way to invoke this ""centrally"", this dialog must
be added to all operations that (potentially) create a commit.

The performance of building a list of ResourceEntries is improved by
checking the file system's support for executable files before
checking the actual file as this requires resolving the file first -
which seems to be expensive when many resources exist. This only
affects platforms that do not support executable files, e.g. Windows.
See bug 325393 for performance results.

It seams that IWorkspaceRoot.getContainerForLocation() and
IWorkspaceRoot.getFileForLocation() are very expensive therefore there
were changed by IWorkspaceRoot.getProject()/IWorkspaceRoot.getFolder()
and IWorkspaceRoot.getFile().

The NonIgnoderFilter were removed from TreeWalk used in
GitResourceVariantTree, since there we only work on data from the
repository with shouldn't include ignored files.

In GitModelCommit.hashCode() we instead of calculating object hash we
simply reuse hash code of wrapped RevCommit object.

When comparing DirCacheEntries to ResourceEntries it is checked
whether they differ with regards to modification timestamp and file
length. Whereas the timestamp is available for all IResources and thus
cached by Eclipse, the file length needed to be retrieved from the
actual file on disk for every comparison.

With this change a session resource property is introduced that stores
the file length once it has been retrieved from disk. The property is
removed whenever a resource changes (by eventing).

Using persistent properties for this scenario first seemed to be an
even better idea, but as these properties are stored on disk by
Eclipse there was a huge performance degradation when filling the
cache, i.e. during the first traversal of a TreeWalk containing a
ContainerTreeIterator (e.g. after startup of Eclipse).

So with this change there is no improvement for the performance of
decorating a project for the first time after Eclipse starts up, but
every refresh on project level as well as all decorations of (deep)
folder structures are significantly improved. Furthermore the
ContainerTreeIterator is also used in other use cases, i.e. when
opening the commit dialog. See bug 325393 for performance results.

With this change a simple caching mechanism for resource decorations
is introduced that is based on two timestamps: one timestamp is
resource-specific and the other one is valid for the entire
workspace.

There are mainly two types of events that GitLightWeightDecorator
handles: on the one hand IResourceChangeEvent, an event that only
affects a dedicated set of resources, and on the other hand various
events that are related to the connected Git repository.

The Git repository events are generic and thus result in firing a
LabelProviderChangedEvent that is handled by views showing decorated
content (e.g. package explorer). Before firing this event the
timestamp on workspace-level now is updated to indicate that all
cached decorations (with a lower timestamp) are invalid.

When handling an IResourceChangeEvent the resource-specific timestamp
is cleared. This means that the cached decoration for this specific
resource is no longer valid. Afterwards the same generic
LabelProviderChangedEvent is fired instead of an event for the
dedicated set of changed resources. This allows every view to
decide what to update instead of forcing an update of invisible
resources as well - which was the case before. This leads to more
re-decorations, but due to the fact that for all unchanged resources
cached information is available, this is very fast and in the end
avoids unnecessary decorations of invisible resources - as mentioned
above.

Since the Git Sharing Wizard now is able to handle multiple projects
that are to be shared with the same repository nicely (i.e. you don't
have to share these projects one by one as before), we can drop the
""share manually"" option in the Git Import wizards. This makes these
wizards much less complex and avoids the need to complete them in the
UI thread.

This is the first step for simplification which removes the page that
is used to manually share newly created projects.

The action is available from the Repository view (on Repository nodes)
as well as via Team > Remote > Fetch a change from Gerrit.

The user needs to select a URI (the dropdown is populated from all
URIs available from all remotes of the current Repository) and a
change. There is a content assist for the change. By clicking
CTRL+Space, the user can see a list of changes and select one.

The user can also paste the change in the form

refs/changes/<nn>/<nnnn>/<nn> from the Gerrit WebUI or type it in
manually if they know the specifics...

There are several options available to perform after fetch was done:
creation of a local branch (default), creation of a tag, checking
out FETCH_HEAD, or doing nothing else (just updating FETCH_HEAD).

If a branch or tag is to be created, a name is suggested in some
pseudo-hierarchical format (""change/<nnnn>/<nn>"" which comes in handy
when the user activates the ""hierarchical branch layout"" in the
Repositories view)...

The RepositoriesView looks up the RepositoryCache with all the
directories it ""knows"". When an Exception occurs, it is logged, but
the corrupt Repository is not removed from the view. When the view is
refreshed or re-initialized, the Exception is logged again.

The Exception described in the bug occurs if the config file does not
contain an entry

core.repositoryformatversion = 0

which is checked in the constructor of FileRepository. The check was
introduced to ensure interoperability with the command line Git.

With this fix, the Exception is only logged once and the offending
Repository is removed from the Repositories View.

This change adds tests for GitChangeSetSorter. It also fixes minor
issues in this class that were found during writing tests.

GitChangeSetSorterTest is fully independent from Eclipse RCP therefore
it can be launched as pure JUnit4 test case.

MockRevCommit class is added to be able to set commit time without
setting up a full git repository, therefore
GitChangeSetSorter.shouldOrderCommitsByCommitDate() will fail with
ClassNotFoundException when this tests is launched as a plug-in test.

This improves the performance of the CommitMessageViewer by
only rendering the commit message and other meta information by
default. The diffs for the files in the commit are not rendered
immediately when clicking on a commit, but only when the user selects
files in the file list.

This results in dramatic performance improvements if there are commits
containing many files.

The user can still click ""select all"" in the file list to get all the
diffs into the view.

In addition, the diffs are rendered asynchronously letting the user
cancel the operation when it takes too long.

Some tracing was added to help maintenance in the future.

This limits the number of commits to show in the history page to ten
thousand. This is a UI Preference available on the Git Preference
page. The user can set this to zero in order to see all commits.

The second thing is to hide the ""tag sequence"" by default. This is
very time and memory-consuming on big repositories. This is changeable
by another Git Preference.

In combination, this makes browsing the Linux 2.6 repository work
without too much waiting and memory overflow.

Due to the asynchronous updates, we have to add a few waits to make
the tests work again. In the longer run, we should probably try and
decouple the commit table, the message viewer, and the file list
updates completely from each other by spawning jobs. Then the tests
should join with these jobs to obtain proper synchronization.

Requires JGit change

http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,2556

Displays the full name of a Ref when hovering over the label in the
HistoryView. This is helpful when the Ref name gets too long and is
shortened during rendering of the commit.

I have tagged this as RFC as the hover sometimes seems to conflict
with the tooltip shown if the width of the message column is too
narrow to show the full message. Perhaps someone has an idea how this
can be avoided.

This tries to reduce the number of duplicate command definitions in
plugin.xml which were done historically in order to achieve
different behavior in different environments, e.g. ""Commit"" in
the team menu would behave differently from ""Commit"" in the
Repositories View context menu.

Instead of having two commands for ""Commit"", we should have one
command and two different handlers with mutually exclusive
""activeWhen"" conditions that handle this command.

The advantage is that we have only one key binding and command name
and that the plugin.xml becomes easier to maintain.

When a resource changes there are several events fired that lead
towards re-decoration of this resource (and parent resources). These
events are often redundant, e.g. when checking out a different
branch, JGit fires a RefsChangedEvent and an IndexChangedEvent.
Furthermore Eclipse detects that a resource changed and thus fires a
ResourceChangeEvent. But in the end only one re-decoration should be
triggered, thus a mechanism is introduced that delays firing an event
for 100ms and ignores further events within this time frame.

This change contains two improvements to the decorator:

1. Outdated decorations are shown until newly calculated decorations
   are available - this reduces 'flickering'
2. ResourceChangeEvents are better filtered - 'false' events are
   ignored (i.e. when a project is opened) and team private resource
   are also not included in the list of changed resources

The label decoration of project nodes contains important information,
i.e. the repository name as well as the current branch. This change
introduces a temporary decoration for project nodes that only contains
this textual (label) information and is shown immediately. The final
decoration is shown as soon as a full recursive walk through the whole
project has been performed.

We can now move and renme projects within a repository for a number

Eclipse actauly destroys the project, we simply forbid it for now
(Platform bug 339814).

This also adds tests for move and delete of folders and files. We are
quite inconsistent so the current behavior may not be the final behavior.

We cannot move projects with repositories inside them in this version and
so we forbid it. Disconnect and share manually to accomplish this.

When having multiple projects (each corresponding to a different
repository) and needing to regularly keep up to date with changes, EGit
provides no easy way to deal with this. The only way at the moment is to
select a single project and pull, and repeat that for every project.
When the number of projects is two, this is okay, but for more than a
couple of projects it's simply infeasible.

This change enables pull for multiple repositories. It's more a proof of
concept and has multiple problems, but it's there to get the discussion
started on how to implement this.

If the user selects a remote (and not a URI) for push and fetch,
respectively, the corresponding wizards should allow to hit ""Finish""
on the first page if the remote is configured properly (i.e. has at
least one URI and a ref spec (for fetch).

The bugs mentioned below are more concerned about the complexity of
the RefSpec page, so if the remote is not configured correctly, this
does not solve the issue, but for the 90 per cent case, the user will
be able to simply hit ""Finish"" without having to go through the other
pages. This also dramatically improves performance, as the
long-running ListRemoteOperation is not needed anymore to fill the
RefSpec combo boxes on the RefSpec page.

The parameter is used for specifying what branch should be checked out
after fetch. Before this change, it was of type Ref. But a Ref is not
really right here, as a Ref should point to a valid object id, and the
ids aren't generally known before a clone. This lead users of
CloneOperation to passing a Ref with only a name set, and no object id
(using a anonymous Ref subclass or passing null as object id).

Before the parameter was a Ref, it already was a String, but one could
only specify a short branch name (e.g. ""master""), not a full ref name
(""refs/heads/master""). With this change, it's still the full ref name,
just as a String.

This is based on the previous work by Mykola Nikishov in change
I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 (""Import a project set file"").
This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
situation where different branches of the same repository should be
imported.

A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:

  git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git|master|org.eclipse.egit

Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
does the following when importing:

- Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
  repository URL and branch name.
- Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
  part of the string (""."" if the repository itself is the .project).
- Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.

Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
for Eclipse < 3.7.

No UI interaction has been implemented yet.

According to discussion we had in bug 326767 I've decided to activate
Workspace model by default instead of Git Change Set model.

This commit also fixes an issue in
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.members method with was causing
misleading results in Workspace model.

Additionally this change includes also UI tests cases for both
Workspace and Git Change Set models. Common parts was moved into
AbstractSynchronizeViewTest.

Because lack of support for check box column in tables in SWT we are
using a hack in Fetch wizard to obtain image for four check box states
(enabled-checked/unchecked and disabled-checked/unchecked).

Previous implementation was creating four times a small window with
one of given check box state. Now we are including all states in
single window, then we are creating proper representation based on
part of created window.

This patch also improve overall Fetch wizard creation time.

This adds some dialogs to be used for checkout and deletion of
branches which are used in the Team->Switch To...->New branch... and
Team->Switch To...->Other... Menu actions.

New Branch... will first call a dialog to select the base (branch,
tag, Reference) and then start the usual wizard with the selected base
as parameter.

Other... will open a dialog to select a branch, tag, or Reference for
checking out. Upon ""Ok"", the Ref is checked out.

With this, users can use specific, simplified UIs for the very common
operations of branch creation and checkout instead of having to use
the generic BranchSelectionDialog which offers too many actions.

When viewing the diff (from the commit dialog) of a file that has a
different encoding than the workspace encoding, it contains incorrect
changes.

One way to reproduce this problem:

- Set the Eclipse workspace encoding to ISO-8859-1.
- Create an XML file that has an explicit UTF-8 encoding set (either
  through an encoding attribute in the XML or as an explicit property on
  the resource). Add some non-ASCII characters in the file.
- Commit it.
- Change some unrelated lines in the file.
- Open the commit dialog.
- View the diff of the file.

Before this change, the diff would show changes in the lines with
non-ASCII characters, even though they didn't change. The reason is that
the encoding of nextFile is correct because it is from the workspace.
But it's wrong for baseFile because it's read as a blob from the repo,
and the diff view therefore falls back to the wrong workspace encoding.

After this change, the encoding from the IFile is also used to decode
the previous file contents, and the diff is correct.

THIS IS NOT COMPLETE, DO NOT MERGE!

This uses the Refactoring capabilities available in Eclipse to allow
sharing an Eclipse project with a Repository that is not located in a
parent folder of the project.

The Sharing Wizard has a new radio button to allow selection of an
existing Repository (from the RepoView) and optionally a relative path
within this repository into which the project is to be shared (always
using the project name as terminating folder).

Upon finish, the project location is then moved to the new target folder
(a child folder of the working directory of the selected
Repository) before the ConnectProviderOperation is executed.

This reverts commit 19f2cf44d7868aa2d4b5faa811af5dbbc9600a12. This
commit changed the behavior so that it opens a new top level window when
you select the 'Compare with->HEAD Revision' menu.  It used to create a
new editor.  This change in behavior is a regression since the top-level
window is disruptive to a standard multi editor workspace.  It also
means standard functions like search and editing are no longer
available. Reverting this commit fixes this regression.

The comparator provides the means to sort a list of strings using a
natural sort order (i.e. ""2"" before ""10""). It had two problems.

The first one was that it could not handle strings that contained many
numbers (when all the numbers concatenated exceeded Integer.MAX_VALUE).
This lead to a NumberFormatException. Because the comparator is used in
CreateBranchPage, it was impossible to create a branch in a repository
that had a ref with such a name (e.g. stable-1-0-0_2011-05-25).

The second one was that it resulted in the wrong order for some inputs.
For example, the following inputs would not be sorted as listed here:

  project-1-0-0-final
  project-1-0-1-beta

With the implementation of this change, it behaves correctly for these
two problems.

This makes the code both faster and easier to read (no complicated
lookahead/lookbehind pattern).

In a real-world use case for sorting 755 refs (a great number of tags),
the result is:

before: 22 ms
after: 3 ms

Using a list of 10000 elements also shows a factor of about 8.

When looking at the history of a single resource in the History view and
then opening a commit in the Commit Viewer, the Files section would show
invalid changes.

The problem was that the parent of the RevCommit was set to the previous
commit for the same resource and therefore the diff included all changes
between those commits (not only to the previous one).

We fix this by re-parsing the commit with a clean RevWalk before showing
it.

repository from the repository view whereas ""Delete Repository"" deletes
a local [clone of a] repository from disk.

The difference btw. these two is not obvious enough. It was suggested to
adda tooltip to the context menu items but this appears not to be
technically possible. 

The patch proposes to rename the context menu item ""Remove Repository""

Adds thin cache that contains meta data (like changed object id's and
change type) from git. This cache is filled in background process just
before synchronization is launched and then it is used for quick
obtaining list of members for particular folder.

During my tests this implementation reduce time needed to compare linux
kernel source (version 2.6.38-rc2 against 2.6.36) in less then 1min
(usually 55s), when implementation from 1.0 needs 1m 40s.

Additionally some tests were updated.

This change requires also jgit change

A composite in the history page was relying on a layout request to
have the layout data automatically generated and set onto the
composite. In the event that the composite's shell has been asked
to have its layout operations deferred, the layout data will not be
automatically generated or set, resulting in possible errors
farther down the code path when another method tries to ask the
composite in question for its layout data. The fix is to explicitly
set a layout data on the composite so that it doesn't have to rely
on a layout operation to have one.

The context that's passed into handlers are not guaranteed to be an
EvaluationContext so performing an instanceof check for that type
may potentially go nowhere. The fix is to use HandlerUtil's
getVariable(Object, String) method for retrieving variables from the
context. This lets the framework handle the processing of the
context instead of having EGit make arbitrary assumptions about the
type of the provided context.

Base commit for improving Git Change Set model performance and reducing

instead of keeping full JGit objects it contains only basic data needed
by synchronize view.

This implementation can change over time. It is possible that during
further refactoring of current Git Change Set implementation more data
will be needed in cache in such case I'll amend this commit.

The 'Git Tree Compare' view had incorrect logic that caused two
editor open requests to be sent to Compare. This meant that when
the 'Reuse Compare Editor' option was selected, the editor would
get closed and when it wasn't selected, two compare editors
would get opened. Removing the first request and letting the
code cascade down to the request at the end of the method fixes
this problem.

The search dialog table that shows the Git repositories was
grabbing an excess amount of space causing the dialog to open
larger than the screen height with no scrollbars on the table.
This was apparent if you had ~50 repositories configured in the
Git Repositories view.

This was due to the fact that the SearchDialog class sets the
layout data on the main control of the search page after it is
created which overrides the locally set data.

The fix prevents setting the layout data on the main control
after is had already been set by using a simple subclass of
Composite.

This also removes the 'L' overlay currently shown for lightweight
tags since it was displayed in the top right corner and would be
invisible when the checked out overlay was also drawn.

The 'L' looked abnormal when in tested in other corners so instead
a new icon was added for annotated tags and lightweight tags will
use the simple tag icon.

The new annotated tag icon is the standard tag icon with an
author overlay on the right side denoting that the tag has a
known tagger and message.

When an element is retrieved from the selection service,
getAdapter(IProject.class) is invoked on it to determine if the
selection can be adapted to become a project. If that cannot be
satisfied, the code should be allowed to proceed normally and
treat the object as it is in the event that the currently
selected object is of a type that supports the switching of
branches.

SpellcheckableMessageArea.getCommitMessage called

line delimiter found in the text control.
The new implementation of SpellcheckableMessageArea.getCommitMessage
guarantees that the returned string only contains \n line endings.

The Git prefix is the location of the user's C Git installation. EGit
does not use C Git, but want to see its system wide configuration.

This mainly affects Windows users, since Git for Windows overrides
defaults in $git_prefix/etc/gitconfig. Additionally many Windows users
do not add Git to PATH, so automatically determining the location often
does not work on Windows.

The overridden Git prefix is stored in the workspace

As the 'Git Staging' view is intended to be a mirror of the 'git
status' command in the command line, it should use the standard
FileTreeIterator from JGit for walking over the working
directory and index. Using EGit APIs that interact with
Eclipse's resources layer will not work correctly because
IContainer's members(*) method will not return excluded
resources. As the command line does not consider excluded
resources any differently from regular files, the 'Git Staging'
view should follow the same guideline and not deviate in its
behaviour and display of information.

As the compare editor input uses the input resources for
determining what it should filter to show, its filter may
potentially be an empty string if the project is both the parent
of the .git folder as well as the selected root resource for the
compare editor to display. If this scenario is satisfied, simply
skip the discovered empty string and don't bother setting a
filter on the walk.

When the merge compare editor input is created, it uses the
resources selected by the user to determine what the tree
structure of compared resources should be. If a selected project
is both the parent of the .git folder as well as the selected
root resource to perform the merge for, an empty string will be
determined as the filter to use for generating the differences.
In this case, a path filter should not be created for the empty
string as it is unnecessary as this would be identical to simply
iterating over all of the files in the repository.

Project label decorations appear as '[ ]' when the
repository is currently being indexed and the index
diff cache returns a null entry for the repository.

This change sets the repository name and branch before the
index diff data is considered in the DecoratableResourceAdapter
class.

It also updates checks for null with checks for empty 
string in cases where the string can never be null in
the GitLightweightDecorator class.

Previously, the encoding was not specified. This could lead to spurious
diffs when the default workspace encoding is different from the file
encoding (e.g. for XML files), because the left and right sides were
decoded differently. An example of where this occurred was the Merge
Tool with the HEAD version as left input.

This this change, the problem-causing constructor of EditableRevision
without encoding argument can be deleted, as this was the last code
using it.

The branch status is shown after the branch name in the decoration if
the current branch is different from the remote tracking branch. This is
useful as a visual indication that the branch needs to be pushed (or
merged/rebased).

If there are commits on the branch that are not on the tracking branch,
an upwards arrow (↑) followed by the number of commits is shown. This
can be read as ""the branch is N commits ahead"" or ""N commits need to be
pushed"".

If there are commits on the tracking branch that are not on the local
branch, a downwards arrow (↓) is shown, followed by the number of
commits. This can be read as ""the branch is N commits behind"" or ""N
commits need to be merged"".

For example, if there are 2 unpushed commits on master, the project is
now shown like this:

  project [repo master ↑2]

If there are both unpushed and unmerged commits (the branches have
diverged), it's shown like this:

  project [repo master ↑2 ↓1]

In C Git, information about the tracking branch is displayed in ""git
status"" output. EGit currently doesn't have any indication that a branch
needs to be pushed, apart from the labels in History View. When there
are multiple repositories involved, it can easily happen that a push is
forgotten. This change helps prevent that.

The history view current displays a status message and hides
the commit graph table when loading or showing no input.  This
produces a flickering when switching between repositories or
when in link with selection mode.

Now the history view keeps the current table input while loading
the new input in the background and shows an empty table when
no commits are found to display.

The status message during loading did not seem necessary since
the job is present in the Progress view with information about
what is being loaded.  Also an empty table seems sufficient to
let the user know there are no commits to display

Also no longer join the cancel job since it can hang the UI-thread.

This change is not intended for a 1.2 release.

Currently the AddToIndexOperation provides the input resources as
scheduling rule. This is wrong because this suggests that two Add To
Index Jobs can run in parallel if the input resources are not
conflicting and belong to the same Git repository.
Now a scheduling rule is used that locks all projects of a given
repository to prevent Jobs running in parallel that modify the index
of the same repository.
The scheduling rules of other EGit operations modifying the Git index
were changed accordingly.

When the number of branches is large, the large amounts of
RevWalk.isMerge translates a gross a amount calls to
MergeBaseGenerator.carryOntoOne with deep stacks. For 8200 branches,
e.g. if you fetch refs/changes/* from Gerrit, this translates
to 50 million calls to carryOntoOne.

In real that is ~3.3 seconds for a repo with the large number
of refs and .06 for a normal clone.

Take a simpler approach and scan every branch until we find the
selected commit or one of it's parents. After this fix info update
with the large refs set is about .5 seconds. For normal clones
there is no difference.

Furthe improvve by using the heuristic that says commit times should
be increasing for each new commit and therefore do not examine branches
whose tip commit is older than the commit we are lookig at. Allow for
a clock skew of 24 hours. After this getBranches() is down to 0.35
seconds.

If after resolving all conflicts nothing is left to commit, behave like

Currently, EGit displays a ""HEAD advanced fast forward"" message, which

The normal user is not interested in Refs like FETCH_HEAD, ORIG_HEAD
etc. when using the HistoryView. However, these Refs can pollute the
view as they can not be hidden independently if ""Show All Branches"" is
active.

The additional Refs are now hidden by default and the user can have
them displayed by checking the Show->Additional Refs menu item toggle
button. The HEAD Ref is always shown independent from this switch.

The RepositoryFinder.register(IContainer, File) method is capable of
regsitering a repository with a path that is not relative to the containing
project, because of the nature of File.getCanonicalFile().  For instance,
if you are working in /dev/workspace/project and that path contains a .git
symlink which points to /dev/repo/project.git, then the registered path for
that repository will be the latter.  However, code in RepositoringMapping.
getGitDirAbsolutePath() and ExistingOrNewPage.fillTreeItemWithGitDirectory()
make assumptions about it being relative to the containing project.

This only occurs in Linux because File.getCanonicalFile() does not have the
same behavior on Windows.  Specifically it doesn't recognize junctions (the
Windows equivalent to symbolic links) and therefore does not try to resolve
them.

This patch addresses the problem by removing the use of
File.getCanonicalFile() and replacing it with File.getAbsoluteFile() which
is already there as a fallback if File.getCanonicalFile() throws an
exception.  This will make the behavior of sharing a project the same on
both Windows and Linux.

When comparing two commits via ""Compare with Each Other"" in History
View, there were two problems:

1. For CHANGE cases, the commit ID label and the actual content of the
   sides did not match. This is fixed by always showing compareRev on
   the left, consistent with setLeftLabel and setRightLabel earlier in
   the code.

2. For ADDITION/DELETION cases, the icon shown in the tree was reversed.
   For an addition (file doesn't exist in base/right, exists in
   compare/left), a [-] was shown (weird). By ORing it with
   Differencer.RIGHT, we get a nice left to right arrow with a +/- in it
   (which is then correct).

By checking that the event data is actually a StagingEntry (i.e. the
drag was started from the staging view), we ensure that no accidental
drops can cause staging.

This makes the staging view no longer use a separat ""Staging view

IndexDiffCacheEntry for the selected repository.

This is WIP, especially as i can't get the SWTBot test to behave.
everything works if i click through manually, but when the bot selects
the repository node in the test, the staging view is not notified, and
thus the view is not updated (breaking the test).

all suggestions welcome!

reflect your feature).

Without being able to do this on the History View, this is rather
cumbersome.

When a new History rendering was triggered a RevWalk is created. This
RevWalk was released when the next history rendering was triggered. 
However, at this point in time the RevWalk may still have been used by
the previous GenerateHistoryJob in another thread. This leads to NPEs.

Now we release the RevWalk when the GenerateHistoryJob is done.

When the history is redrawn a new RevWalk is created and configured
corresponding to the settings of the history view. This RevWalk is used
in the scheduled GenerateHistoryJob.

The RevWalk was stored in a field in the GitHistoryPage, although it is
not a property of such a Page. This can potentially lead to problem, and
indeed it caused bug 374675 which was fixed by
3604b5cd5fbf6ac354bc2a247115df7eade81959.

By passing it as a parameter the scope of the RevWalk instance is made
clearer.

This reverts commit f95c105980fc8dc1c356665bb796f256d62bf1ca.

The problem with the save action is that it also results in removed
braces for the if in the following example:

  if (foo)
    try {
      bar();
    } finally {
      baz();
    }

Which, altough it's a single statement, isn't recommended because it's
longer than one line and confusing.

See I1279030286ef177f3360ff70660a9365e4f3119a for the exact reasons.

2. Branch deletion executed multiple workspace runnables. A top level
workspace runnable is added to provide atomicity and to avoid multiple

3. RepositoryPropertySourceProvider performed a syncExec in its config

tracking branch (which means the commit is no longer just local).

In the commit dialog, the warning is shown as a dialog message, the same
way the existing warnings already are.

In the staging view, a label above the commit message editor is shown
when there is a warning. It's not only used for the amend warning, but
also warnings about author and committer text, the same way as in the
commit dialog.

This simplifies setting up the Eclipse workspace and allows to use
Eclipse versions for development which are not matching the target
platform version. In order to set a target platform open it using the
target editor and click ""Set as Target Platform"". The EGit Maven build
now also is based on the same target platform definition. This way
dependencies used in the Maven build are identical to those used in
Eclipse.

This change is a prerequisite for change
Id9d721ae574a83ad9440a93ddb143b1271fc2b2b as this is using a feature of
the team framework only available in Juno. Without a target platform
definition this could not be built in older Eclipse versions.

Previously a RenameCallback was registered on the FollowFilter
to find the previous path of the file being compared.  This
led to incorrect behavior since the callback fires for all
renames, not just for the commits processed through directly
calling RevWalk.next().

Now a RenameDetector is directly used after computing the
diffs between the head commit and the previous commit.
The path is only updated if the rename detector detects
that the current path was renamed between the two commits.

dispose() is always called on the UI-thread so schedule

A Git user may have important settings in the system wide configuration

Egit
tries to find that file automatically by looking for the git executable.
If Git cannot be found then EGit also cannot find the system wide
settings.

In order to stay compatible with Git, in particulary on Windows, where
Git
may not appear in %PATH%, it is important that the user gets notified
that
there may be a problem. The most important setting is typically
core.autocrlf.

IndexDiffCacheEntry.waitForWorkspaceLock is used to synchronize
IndexDiff calculations with workspace changes. IndexDiff calculation is
started when the workspace can be locked.
The old implementation performed an empty Workspace.run to achieve this.
This could result in the state that Workspace.run acquires scheduling
rule workspace root and waits for OrderedLock because another thread is
broadcasting changes.
To avoid this blocking of workspace root waitForWorkspaceLock now avoids
calling Workspace.run. Instead JobManager().beginRule is used to wait.

personally. They were checking all EGit features and were confused when

With the more specific name and an extended description, it should be
clear that this is an optional feature that is not needed by non-PDE

If the selection only includes workspace resources, the normal
DeleteResourceAction is used. Because of this, the delete can even be
undone. This change also makes the undo and redo menu items available
when the staging view is focused for this to be discoverable.

If the selection includes a non-workspace resource, the action is
carried out by a new DeleteResourcesOperation, which can handle
non-workspace resources. This has no undo support though.

The new operation can later also be used for offering Delete for Working
Directory files in the Repositories view.

This makes errors/warnings on the files visible while committing.
Before, these could only be noticed in other places before committing
(e.g. the package explorer).

In an early draft of this change, the decoration was done directly in
StagingViewLabelProvider (without using IDecoratorManager). The problem
with that approach was that the decorations didn't get updated after
editing a file.

With the extension point and IDecoratorManager, updating the decoration
works. And, except for having to exclude GitLightweightDecorator via
IDecorationContext, it feels cleaner.

It sometimes happens that a resolved merge/cherry-pick is the same as
HEAD, in which case no files are staged for commit.

Before this change, the user was stuck in this state as the staging view
and commit dialog both refused to do a commit without staged files.

With this change, an empty commit is now allowed when the repository
state is MERGING_RESOLVED or CHERRY_PICKING_RESOLVED.

JGit change I1333a8dd170bb0077f491962013485efb6f2a926 is about improving
the ours/theirs conflict markers during rebase. The way the rebase
action worked before, it would always pass the commit ID to rebase,
which is not very helpful during a rebase conflict.

This change makes it use a Ref if there is one. If there are multiple
refs pointing to the selected commit:

- and if the branch being rebased tracks another one, this tracked
  branch should be the one to pick if it's in the list
- otherwise pick a remote tracking branch if it's in the list

Also adds a ""does it work at all?"" test for rebase in History view.

This extends the hard wrapping of the commit message in the Staging View
and Commit Dialog.

With the previous behavior, if one had a finished line/paragraph and
added text at the front, the text at the end would get
wrapped
like
this.

That made manual re-wrapping necessary. In the case of a paragraph,
several lines had to be edited again.

This change improves that use case by turning the line delimiter after a
wrapped word into a space to join the lines. It takes care not to join
empty lines or lines which start with a symbol (e.g. a bullet list).

It also gets rid of flickering during wrapping by only redrawing after
having applied all edits.

RepositoryCache is not removing repositories that were deleted. When queried
it will deliver old entries for a new repo created at the very same path.
I now remove dead repos when they're looked up and when all repos are

When the Tree Compare was opened for comparing files from two commits,

Now it tries to get a better encoding through
CompareCoreUtils.getResourceEncoding, as we do in other places.

Also, to discourage the use of FileRevisionTypedElement without
specifying an encoding, the constructor without encoding is removed, as
the last usages of it were in Tree Compare.

The implementations of getMappingForNonWorkspaceResource() and
getRepoRelativePath() in RepositoryMapping were confusing workspace
paths with filesystem locations. On certain platforms, they may actually
be the same, but e.g. on Windows this is never the case and leads to all
kinds of problems.

The problem is that IResource#getFullPath() returns e.g. /foo/bar (where
/ means workspace root), whereas IResource#getLocation() returns the
absolute file system path. This caused later code which treated the
paths as absolute file system paths to return incorrect results.

Instead of incorrectly using an IResource for non-workspace files, we
now work with IPath if necessary, e.g. for comparing with index from
Staging View.

EGit considers derived resources as if they were mentioned in
.gitignore. This looks like a nice Eclipse integration on first sight,
but it causes trouble when git is used on the command line (since
derived resources are not ignored there). This might also break
consistency when some developers use a different type of IDE or editor
which doesn't share Eclipse's opinion about which Resources are derived.
Fix this by no longer considering this hint provided by the Team
framework.

CompareWithHeadActionHandler now also uses the correctly behaving
getHeadTypedElement from CompareUtils for a single file.

The existing useful behavior of getting the commit that last modified
the file (instead of HEAD) is moved to the getHeadTypedElement method,
so all other users also benefit from that.

Also, release the used RevWalk.

When the History view is filtered to only show commits of the selected
resource, creating a patch resulted in an incorrect diff. The problem
was that the RevCommit was used as is, and the parent was the one as
shown in the History view, not the real parent of the commit.

Test with e.g. ApplyCommand from JGit, filter the History view to
resource, and then Create Patch. The diff should be pretty small.

WorkbenchTreeContentProvider had a serious problem in that it only
descended into folders which existed in the workspace. The reason for
that was that it used getChildren of its base class
WorkbenchContentProvider.

For example, when the base (workspace) version had these files:

  a
  b/1

And compare version had these:

  a
  b/1
  c/1

The ""c/1"" file should be shown as ""deleted"" in the view. The problem was
that the ""c"" folder was not contained in the workspace and so the
content provider never included ""c/1"". It did include deleted files
whose parent folder was known, but not others.

This could maybe have been fixed by introducing artificial folder nodes
(implementing IWorkbenchAdapter) in such a situation (but only for the
special case above).

Instead, this change unifies the workbench with the PathNode content
provider code. Care was taken to keep the appearance by using
WorkbenchLabelProvider for container nodes and continuing to work with
IFile where possible. The tree construction was also simplified.

It was not working because of a handler conflict. The problem was that
it was registered using the workbench handler service in the staging
view.

By using the site-specific handler service via getHandlerService, the
conflict no longer exists and the keybinding works.

The refspec panel passed strings like ""master [branch]"" to the revision
parser. The revision parser used to allow garbage after the revision,
but was tightened, which then triggered this bug.

Instead of working with the content proposal label, add a method to get
the corresponding content. Then use this when working with ref specs.

Also just overwrite the combo text when it changes, otherwise the nice
label like ""master [branch]"" is replaced by ""refs/heads/master"", even
though it would not have been necessary.

Another unhandled RevisionSyntaxException was in tryResolveLocalRef,
e.g. when calling completion with ""refs/"".

The context menu actions ""Replace with File in Git Index"" and ""Replace
with HEAD revision"" in the unstaged changes table have the same result
for MODIFIED files. Showing both is redundant and can confuse newcomers.

Therefore remove the replace with index action, as the other is easier
to understand (the mental model of the user may be that the index only
contains changed files).

Both actions are still shown for PARTIALLY_MODIFIED, where they actually
cause different results.

This reverts commit 7a406934a668abcf665edc5de9830f08b2065755 (change
I3c73212eadb883c598aee1ef8af882e0f7725899).

It was causing multiple regressions:

When modifying the contents in the compare editor, it could not be
saved, see bug 393990.

When using the Merge Tool with the ""Use HEAD"" option, the contents of
the workspace file were shown instead of that of the passed file
revision, see bug 395177.

Pushing a branch to a remote for which there is a tracking branch should
update the tracking branch. This was not the case when using the ""Push""
action in the Synchronize view.

The solution involves two parts. First, PushOperation did not consider
fetch refspecs while calculating RemoteRefUpdates. Changing that caused
the RemoteRefUpdates to correctly include a TrackingRefUpdate.

Second, PushOperationUI used to take the passed RemoteRefUpdates and
then create RefSpecs for passing to the PushCommand. In this conversion,
tracking ref updates are lost. By using the transport API we can
directly pass the RemoteRefUpdates.

Another solution would have been to pass the remote name to the
PushCommand instead of a bare URIsh, but that would have involved
changing PushOperationSpecification (which only uses URIish).

Filtered resources are useful when working with nested projects, like
this:

  root/
    .project
    sub/
      .project

In the above configuration, the root project typically contains resource
filters so that ""sub"" is not shown as a subdirectory of root in
navigator views but can be imported as a separate project.

When resources are filtered, they are not returned from API like
IContainer#members. So ContainerTreeIterator needs to check if resource
filters are configured and if that's the case, list additional
files/folders through the Java File API. It then falls back to
AdaptableFileTreeIterator for subtrees.

This depends on small changes in JGit's FileTreeIterator, see below.

But the returned RevCommit is later used to get author information,
which is only possible with a parsed body.

Also release the RevWalk.

When an incremental refresh is done before any full refresh,
indexDiffData is null, which could lead to an NPE. So do a full refresh
instead when no prior indexDiffData is available.

This can happen because full reload jobs cancel each other, whereas an
incremental reload job is never cancelled. Whether this is desired
should be investigated separately.

This change also renames the methods for more clarity.

There were a few things contributing to the instability:

- The test setup was only done once in @BeforeClass and then ""cleaned
  up"" by doing a reset twice and waiting. Setup is now done in @Before
  and a complete cleanup is done in @After, so that test execution order
  does not affect the outcome.

- Switching between ""Git Commits"" and ""Workspace"" models was done by
  clicking on the drop down in the Synchronize view toolbar, which is
  very fragile. The desired model is now enabled via team API once for
  each test class.

With this, 2 tests no longer need to be ignored and all tests succeed
reliably on my machine.

In a nested project layout, e.g.:

  root/
    .project
    sub/
      .project
      a.txt

""sub"" is not necessarily excluded from root with resource filters.

So when calling ResourceUtil.getFileForLocation for a.txt,
IWorkspaceRoot#getFileForLocation (before this change) would return an
IFile belonging to the root project, even when it was closed. When the
project is closed, IFile returns false from exists() and later results
in the RepositoryMapping not being found.

One way to fix this would be to only return the IFile if it exists(),
and return null otherwise.

But in the above case, we can return an IFile that exists, from the sub
project. To find this, we call findFilesForLocationURI and then return
the first file which exists.

This fixes the reported problem while also including linked resources,
which is desired in the future.

Do not queue jobs unnecessarily and eliminate some unneeded jobs. As it
turns out, this is mostly a cosmetic problem.

The jobs have a potentially long initialization where they just lessen
the risk of executing in parallel with other heavy jobs. During this
period we may still cancel previous jobs just to queue a new one,
getting a huge queue of jobs. For the full re-indexing jobs, we can just
ignore re-indexing since the first one will do all necessary work.

Also acknowledge the fact the full re-indexing job does all work that an
incremental indexing job does and therefore we can skip launching an
incremental indexing job if a full reindexing operation is imminent (in
locking phase).

The problem was that it returned a child for each changed file, instead
of only the direct children. So e.g. with changes in ""dir/a"", ""dir/b""
and ""dir/c"", it returned a node for ""dir"" three times. When the number
of changes is significant, this resulted in many children returned, each
of which also has children which will be processed by the calling code.

The code in GitModelCommit for tree construction did it right. To fix
this, this change consolidates the two tree construction implementations
into one which should be correct.

It also takes care that the final tree nodes use as little memory as
possible by using arrays.

The fix for bug 360073 changed the History view file diff viewer to show
all files of a commit, regardless of the resource filter. This made it
sometimes hard to find the files that the filter is focused on.

This change improves that by rendering the files that are not matched by
the filter in gray. The matching files are rendered in the same color as
before. With this, the files can be found at a glance instead of reading
through the paths.

This removes two unused (and outdated) tests in
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriberTest. The third one was removed since
it was not testing what was advertised : it mocked a use case where the
user was synchronizing a branch with only one comit with a master that
also had a single commit, that thus acted as both the ""remote"" _and_
""common ancestor"" of the synchronization. What we want is a use case
where all three revisions are distinct.

During rebase, the rebase pulldown menu in the toolbar was always
disabled, resulting in no way to do a ""abort"" or other actions through
the toolbar.

The problem is that the enabled state of the action handler for the main
action also determines whether the pulldown menu can be opened (the
little arrow besides the icon). So instead of disabling it when rebase
is not possible, also enable it during rebase, and check state again
when executing.

The logic in getMapping did not cover the case properly when a path was
totally outside a repository mapping. For example, when workingTree is
""C:\my\working\tree"" and the path in question is ""D:\a\cloned\repo""
path.makeRelativ(workingTree) would return path ""D:\a\cloned\repo"". As a
result, the if clause is true and the mapping is returned although the
working tree from the mapping is completely unrelated to the path.

A better (and simpler) way is to simply use workingTree.isPrefixOf(path)
for the check. This properly determines if a path is within a working
tree.

The commit also adds a test for detecting the situation.

When using GitFileHistoryProvider.getFileHistoryFor(IResource,...), a
user expects the full history of the target resource to be returned,
except if the SINGLE_REVISION or SINGLE_LINE_OF_DESCENT flags are
positioned.

The SINGLE_REVISION flag is properly handled, however when no flags are
set, EGit previously returned only the commits descending from HEAD,
without considering the history that exists on other branches or
references.

This adds specific tests to make sure of the behavior when either no
flag or the SINGLE_REVISION flag are set.

The history's ""getTarget"" and ""getContributors"" were rewritten to allow
for some of Team quirks: when using the synchronize view, Team will use
its own file revisions instead of what was originally fed to it. We thus
need to adapt those revisions to types known to us. A specific test
demonstrating this use case has been added.

Running the SWTBot test suite on a windows environment highlights an
insidious file handle leaks coming from the WindowCache used in
conjunction with JGit parsed repositories. "".pack"" files are opened for
reading and thus locked for deletion until the repo is properly closed,
but EGit might not keep a reference towards this repository in its
cache, ""forgetting"" to close it when needed. This is mostly true for
sub-modules.

This patch also gets rid of other random errors : an URL missing from
a configured remote repository, making the ""push"" fail, a .project not

What GirFileRevision really expects is a path, not a file name. Most
usages of the constructors already passed in a file path... but the
parameter naming led to a number of clients to use a file name, which
creates FileRevisions with no resolvable path. This fixes all
ambiguous parameter names and usages.

With certain workflows (non-Gerrit), creating a branch and pushing it to
a remote (including setup of branch tracking) is a common operation.
Currently, this is pretty complicated with EGit and a source of errors,
bug reports and help requests.

This change tries to provide a solution for the following use cases:

* The user created a new repository and wants to push it for the first
  time (no remotes yet).

* The user created a new feature branch and wants to push it to a
  remote, and set up tracking in the same step (git push -u).

It adds an additional wizard and provides it in place of the ""push to
upstream"" action when no tracking branch is configured yet. It's also
available in the context menu of a branch in the repositories view.

The util method now includes more logic for finding the right one, which

Additionally, selectionIncludesNonWorkspaceResources in StagingView now
uses StagingEntry.getFile instead of implementing similar but not quite
the same logic.

This fixes some strange behavior with nested projects.

Workspace synchronization is launched on a given repository (or ""a
project of a given repository""). This repository may contain commits
on files that were not imported in the workspace. In such a case, the
GitContainerMapping corresponding to that commit shouldn't create
traversals for the files that are not in the workspace, as that would
fail later on in NPEs.

This improvement may also serve as a basis to allow a ""synchronize
project"" (or ""synchronize folder"") action instead of ""synchronize
workspace""; i.e. restrict the scope of a synchronization to only part
of a repository.

The fix provides stronger checks on selected linked resources before
enabling menu items. In particular, linked resources that point to a
file that is part of a project shared with egit are allowed to be
operated on. Otherwise team actions are disabled if the selection
contains a linked resource pointing to a file outside any project and
repository. A default isEnabled() implementation is provided for this
behavior. After adding a test case a couple more handlers have been
amended and made compliant.

not stable and subject to future improvement. Users that want to use the
(now internal) API's in upcoming major revisions should ask for this
explicitly.

Since Gerrit 2.3 the path segment /p is not needed anymore when
accessing Gerrit with the http protocol [1].

This patch was initially created because there was a bug in Gerrit when
pushing with /p [2], which has been fixed in the meantime. When testing
the change, bug 407984 was detected.

The logic to add /p is removed from the Gerrit Configuration wizard in
order to fix bug 407984, avoid unnecessary complexity and because
Gerrit 2.3 is deprecated since a long time: 2.3 was released in April
2012, the latest release is 2.5.4 and 2.6 will be released soon.

The ""merge"" key in a branch section of .git/config describes the name of
the branch as it is called on the remote. So it contains e.g.
""refs/heads/master"", not ""refs/remotes/origin/master"".

The dialog for configuring a branch (repo view > Configure Branch...)
just showed all refs, making it likely for users to configure the wrong
thing.

It now calculates the refs based on the value of the remote entry, by
mapping remote tracking refs back to how they are called on the remote
(according to the fetch specs) and only showing the matching refs.

Because the values in the branch combo now depend on the values in the
remote combo, show the remote combo first (for a clear flow).

In NavigatorDragAdapter, used by the Navigator view, dragFinished
deletes the dragged resources when the operation was DND.DROP_MOVE.

This resulted in the dragged files being deleted when dropping onto the
""Unstaged Changes"" or ""Staged Changes"" in the Staging view.

This was the case even before bug 385412 introduced the possibility to
stage via drag and drop from Package Explorer.

The reason that this bug didn't occur with the Package Explorer is
because it doesn't delete files after DND.DROP_MOVE (which seems like a
more sane behavior).

The problem was that IgnoreOperation#calcSchedulingRule and
IgnoreOperation#addIgnore used different methods to get an IContainer
from the IPath. In case of nested projects, this could result in them
getting different IContainers, which lead to an error like ""Attempted to
beginRule: /container1, does not match outer scope rule /container2"".

To make the test case check the rule, it had to be wrapped in a job.

See bug for how to reproduce. The fix consists of two parts:

1. Change isVisible to getVisible.

For isVisible to be true, the parents of also have to be visible. In the
case of the warning label, we also want to correctly toggle it even if
e.g. the staging view is not currently visible.

2. Rework modify handlers

Instead of requiring users of CommitMessageComponent to handle modify
events of author/committer texts themselves, handle it in the component.
The advantage of this is that the message does not have to be updated
when the listeners in the component are disabled. Before this, a warning
would theoretically be shown for a brief moment when authorText.setText
was called inside updateUI but the committer was not yet set.

The first part alone would have been enough to fix the problem. The
second part improves the code by making it simpler.

IMergeContext offers API for clients to merge files or models through
pure Team APIs, without resorting to repository provider dependencies.
This adds tests for these actions and fixes some issues (NPEs) because
of EGit UI not checking whether the workbench is initialized before
using it.

As the sync view tests also use the compare editor, abstract this in a

It was not clear how to order menu entries defined via the deprecated

So they are now defined using the non-deprecated org.eclipse.ui.menus.

To not duplicate visibleWhen expressions, they are defined via
org.eclipse.core.expressions.definitions, which enables reuse.

It now requires the user to explicitly check that the .git dir should be
deleted before the dialog can be confirmed. It also displays a warning
that the deletion is permanent and changes some labels for clarity.

The paths are now shown below the checkbox for better alignment and to
make them selectable (see ""Delete Project"" where this is also done).

A common mistake for new users of EGit is that they want to work on a
branch existing on a remote and therefore check out the remote-tracking
branch. Instead the right thing to do would have been to create a new
local branch based on it.

This change shows a question whether to create a new local branch or
whether to check out the commit behind the remote-tracking branch.

To make it clear that there will be a question, the label is
""Checkout..."" instead of ""Checkout"" when a remote-tracking branch is
selected.

Because getNewPath was used, which returns /dev/null for deleted files,
the path could not be found and the following error was shown:

  File /dev/null is not contained in commit

This fixes it by using the old path in case of a delete.

The problem was that getActivePart in the old code returned null in the

Preparing the rebase todo lines in a callback method may be a long
lasting user interaction. Doing this with the callback method
prepareSteps(...) in the RebaseInteractiveHandler implies to make the
thread that is calling back sleep until the user has finished
preparation. When the rebase command is returning after initialization
there is no need to make a thread sleep. The rebase todo file can be
edited via writeRebaseTodoFile(...) of the Repository class. The rebase
(interactive) has then to be invoked with PROCESS_STEPS in order to
start the processing.  Note that the Method prepareSteps(...) of the
RebaseInteractiveHandler will be called anyway just before starting to
process the rebase todo file.

As a default, I think having the tree expanded makes more sense than
collapsed, so that the files can be seen instead of just some parent
folders. Using the compact tree, I caught myself always pressing ""Expand
All"" as the first step after starting Eclipse, and I've seen other
people being bothered by having to expand the nodes (I don't know why
they didn't use the ""Expand All"" button though).

In the list view, we were always showing all files, so performance
should not be a problem. And as soon as the user collapses a node, ""auto
expand"" is disabled as implemented in an earlier change.

In the future, we could also consider persisting the state.

In EGit 3.0, the ""new"" state was shown on the left and the ""old"" on the
right, which is consistent with other Eclipse usage, see bug 213780.

In the fix for bug 416808, the sides were switched (probably not
intentionally).

This restores the order and also renames the parameters in the compare
methods to be more clear. It's now also more consistent with how
includeLocal is handled, as local is shown on the left and uses the
""old"" parameter for the right side.

enableCommitWidgets was changed to also disable them in case of
conflicts. This is fine for the commit related buttons, but refresh
should not be disabled then.

On certain cumbersome platforms (looking at you, Windows), a branch
switch may fail when something is running that uses the files. In case
of launch configurations inside Eclipse, we can detect that and warn the
user about it.

We could even offer to terminate it, but as termination may be async, we
just offer continue/cancel. The user can also choose to not show any
warnings again.

The code for detecing this searches the ISourceContainer of the launches
to see if one is for a project of the repository. This works e.g. for
""Java Application"" run configurations and also for servers (WST). I
first tried ILaunchConfiguration#getMappedResources, but it does not
return anything for servers. Maybe there is an easier way, but I
couldn't find it.

See bug for how to test this with servers.

Before, parsing the tags was done in different places. For the image
(annotated vs lightweight), the tag was always parsed. For the check
mark when tag is checked out, the tag was parsed again. And in case of
the option ""Display Latest Branch Commit"" being enabled, the tag was
parsed a third time.

With this change, each tag is parsed only once in the content provider
and the result is stored in the TagNode. Also, it uses one RevWalk
instance instead of N.

The most common cause of unstable UI tests was that the test data
(repositories and projects) was set up once per class, and then each
test method used the same data. When one test method only reads the data
but another modifies it, the test may fail depending on the order of
execution.

This is an attempt to fix this by changing the test setup so that it's
done once per test method (@Before instead of @BeforeClass). To make it
easier (and possibly faster) to clean up and reduce the possibility of
accidentally sharing the data, the data for each test method is created
in a separate directory.

When a remote repository could not be reached there was a dialog which
only described some of the possible scenarios. Moreover, it always
proposed to look at the ssh preferences, even if ssh was not used.

We now give more explanation about possible failures. Possible errors
in case of ssh or https are only shown when these protocols are used.

The Exception was not logged, this is fixed now as well.

In further change we could also react on the concrete type of the
Exception thrown inside JGit. E.g., an
org.eclipse.jgit.errors.NoRemoteRepositoryException would indicate that
there is no network problem but a wrong repository path.

This change extends the information that is shown when hovering over a
annotation revision:

A diff to each parent (normally just one) is shown. Only the hunk
concerning the current line is used to keep the diff small. This helps
in understanding what the blamed commit changed in the current line.

The text above the diff shows the parent commit ID and includes a link
to show the annotations of this parent commit. When clicked, a new
editor is opened for showing annotations for that commit. It also jumps
to the correct line.

Together, this enables quickly going through the history of a file and
inspect the changes that happened over time.

Before, the commit that was shown was the blamed commit from the cursor
position, which could be confusing to the user.

To solve this, two things needed to be changed:

The first time a selection changed event happens for the revision
selection provider, we ignore it as it is for the ""initial"" selection.
The confusing thing about this is that the user has not yet consciously
selected a revision. To fix this, we now always ignore the very first
selection.

When opening an editor with annotation for a start commit (e.g. for the
show annotations link in a hover), we now show this commit in the
history view.

Instead of calculating the resource on each access, calculate them once
and store them in a field. With 4000 unstaged changes in a test
repository, this brought down the time to expand all elements from 3
seconds to 500-800 ms.

Maybe getting the resources could be made faster by not using
findFilesForLocationURI/findContainersForLocationURI, but instead going
through the projects of the repository and using getFile/getFolder and
only falling back to the above in case nothing is found.

On a test repository with 4000 changed files, switching between
presentations was 6 seconds before, 1 second after this change.

One problem was that expanding the previously expanded elements was
unnecessarily done when switching presentations.

Also, the refresh was done twice because run() is also called for the
deselected action. See bug 422910 about improving the documentation of
IAction.AS_RADIO_BUTTON.

Do the following:

1. Start the Git import wizard
2. Clone the repository directly into the workspace (e.g. /home/ws and

This reverts commit 286de3ec27a8bd10087e2002624b38be0762f303.

Using the org.eclipse.ui.menus extension point instead of
org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus triggers bug 422909 in Platform UI. The effect
is that the editor context menu does not have the menu EGit entries.

This changes the order by reordering the existing actions. Note that the
order in plugin.xml has to be the reverse of what is desired in the
popup menu. It also changes ""Replace With > File in Git Index"" to be
consistent with ""Compare With > Git Index"".

The previous changes for this also converted the menu from being defined
via the deprecated org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus extension point to
org.eclipse.ui.menus, but that caused bug 422907 (a bug in Platform UI).

When a repository has many branches or tags, the selection with the
combo is ineffective (e.g. no filtering). Apart from that, it slows down
the dialog even when the user does not intend to change the source
branch.

This changes it to a ""Select..."" button which shows a branch selection
dialog where the user can filter.

To clean up the appearance, an icon is shown for the source branch
representing the type and the short branch/tag name is used (that's the
name the user sees everywhere else).

The GenerateHistoryJob was scheduled over and over when the following
precondiations were met:

 - The preference ""Team > Git > History > Maximum number of commits to 
   show"" has to be set to a numer smaller than the number of commits
   in a repository
 - The history of the repository is fully loaded into the History view
 - The user scrolls down to the end

Scrolling triggers the event listener added in the constructor of 
CommitGraphTable (This is done to implement incremental loading).
The event listener calls the method loadItem of GitHistory Page to load
a given commit specified by its index. This method asks the 
GenerateHistoryJob if the commit is less than BATCH_SIZE / 2 away from 
the end, and if so, triggers a new GenerateHistoryJob.

After loading the commits the GenerateHistoryJob wrongly computed the
value of the incomplete variable. It did not check if all commits of 
the history were loaded. Because of that the updateUI method did render
the UI again leading to another call of the event listener above.

This commit adds a check if all commits are loaded. 
This is unfortunately not easily done with the SWTCommitList.

So we check if no new commits were loaded in the current invocation of 
the GenerateHistoryJob and in that case step out of the loop before 
the check for incomplete is done. Then the method updateUI in 
GenerateHistoryJob will not render the UI again and not start the 
endless loop anymore.

But the updateUI method has to render the UI once more after all 
commits are loaded. This is ensured by the new field
forcedRedrawsAfterListIsCompleted.

refreshes e.g. by changing files in the file system should use
WorkspaceJob. This will batch resource change events until the job is
finished running and remove the overhead imposed by repeated UI
refreshes reacting on events trickling in if not batched.

When trying to filter the directory with the Android open source
repositories (around 1400 repos) there is a delay of several seconds
after each update of the filter mask.

The performance issue is caused by getting the checked items during
filter evaluation of each item completely again and therefore has O(n^2)
runtime. This change caches the checked items after each change of a
checkmark.

With the change there is no notable delay when filtering the same list
of 1400 repositories.

When a commit is performed, the user is asked to save all dirty editors.
Even if she does save some or all of them, the commit continues. The
changes that are saved, are not staged and thus not part of the commit.

If the user actually saved a file, we now ask her whether she wants to
cancel committing, to be able to stage the freshly saved files.

This only applies to commits via the staging view. The commit dialog
already allows the user to stage saved files without needing zo cancel.

When doing a pull, commit or other operations that change refs, existing
GitDocuments are reloaded. GitDocument is used for Quick Diff, which is
active when the user uses Quick Diff, or when ""Show Annotations"" was
called.

Doing this possibly expensive operation (it can involve rename
detection) on the UI thread blocks the UI, so do it in a background job
instead. Note that RemoteRevisionQuickDiffProvider (for CVS) of
eclipse.platform.team does it the same way.

How to reproduce:

1. Add a few lines in the middle of a tracked file
2. Save the file
3. Execute ""Show Annotations""

Expected: The annotations for the lines below the added ones should be
correct.
Actual: They are at the wrong location (too far down)

The problem is that BlameCommand also reads the local file content when
startCommit is not set. But in Eclipse, local changes are already
handled by the Quick Diff provider. So before, they were accounted for
twice. By only blaming HEAD, the Quick Diff logic can work correctly.

The view registers as a RebaseInteractivePlanChangeListener with the
plan, but it never unregistered. After closing the view on a running
interactive rebase and reopening it, it would notify the already
disposed old view, too. This resulted in a ""Widget disposed"" exception,
e.g. when using the buttons to move commits up or down in the rebase
view.

Also unregisters when another plan is shown.

The enablement of the buttons in the branch selection dialog depends on

branch, then the delete and rename buttons should be disabled (as it
already happens for the okay button).

The buttons will automatically be enabled if there is some initial
branch highlighting, as that is evaluated afterwards (see existing
comment in line 327).

This resulted in the existing GitDocument never being disposed, which in
turn caused unnecessary work being done in GitDocument#onRefsChanged,
slowing down operations.

That GitQuickDiffProvider#getReference can be called multiple times can
be seen by adding a breakpoint and then doing this:

1. Show annotations in a tracked file -> first call
2. Edit the file
3. Commit the changes -> second call

The check for RepositoryProvider can be removed as it's done anyway in
GitDocument.create.

""Format: None"" is a confusing default choice.

""Header format: None"" would be a bit better, but in fact the formats are
not only about the header, but also how paths are printed. For example,
""Eclipse workspace"" uses project-relative paths.

Sometimes one wants to fetch a change from gerrit to perform a code
review at a future time.  In that case, it is nice to not checkout the
newly created branch, not only to save time, but also to avoid having to
commit any un-committed changes to the users's current working branch.

By default, this new option will on (checkout) to behave as before.

For detecting whether a fetch is possible, just check if any of the data
has a dstRemoteName.

Because dstRemoteName was also set for HEAD and local branches (which
does not make much sense), GitSynchronizeData was adapted to only set
them in case of remote-tracking branches. The logic was also improved to
check the remote configs instead of just pattern matching.

I noticed that GitSynchronizeData's getSrcMerge was only used in tests
and getSrcRemoteName only used in PushAction. But there, isEnabled was
testing dstRemoteName, while runPushOperation was using srcRemoteName.
But dstRemoteName makes more sense, as it is used together with
getDstMerge. So, this change also removes the two unused fields,
including associated logic.

Connecting a project with a .git repository in one of its subdirectories
breaks the Team menu for the project and makes the subdirectory
disappear. When this happens with ""auto share"", it's very confusing.

Other places in the code could also not really handle this, e.g. the
share wizard displayed the repository location as "".git"", when it really
should have shown ""sub/dir/.git"".

When viewing a repository in the Staging View for the first time after
starting Eclipse, the IndexDiff data for this repository is usually not
available yet. During StagingView.reload(), first the stored Staging
View state is restored. Then enableCommitWidgets(false) is called,
which disables everything, and worse, also clears the just restored
inputs, including the commit message.

When the IndexDiff for the repository becomes available, reload() will
be called again.
This change postpones restoring the view state to that time. This way
the restored commit (and amend etc.) state remains intact. With the
IndexDiff available, the inputs will not be cleared after restoring them
(unless there are conflicts to be resolved).

This change prepares for commit message restore after restarting
Eclipse.

when switching the repository displayed in the staging view.

The restore part already exists and together with this change will now
prevent lost commit messages due to Eclipse restarts.

If a rebase action button (e.g. ""squash"") is already pushed in, clicking
it again now switches the action for the selected rebase lines to
""pick"". This allows toggling between ""pick"" and another action by
repeatedly clicking the button of the other action.

Remove the newline characters introduced in commit 8443147. They led to
problems in the Eclipse window title, since that uses the tooltip text
to compose the title.

The additional labels semm to be confusing for novice (E)Git users.
Especially ORIG_HEAD after a rebase is problematic, because it causes
the History view to show the commits before the rebase, as well as the
rebased commits.

Enhance this to also enable Gerrit actions if a fetch refspec exists
with both source and destination are starting with 'refs/notes/'.

This modifies the Cherry Pick menu item in the History view such that
multiple selected commits may be cherry-picked at once, instead of
one-by-one.

If a conflict occurs during merging one of the commits, the whole
process will stop with an error message. The conflict then needs to be
resolved and committed. (This has not changed from the previous
behaviour.) After that, cherry-picking may be resumed manually with the
leftover commits.

Provides a way to stash changes as well as viewing the existing stashes.

The toolbar icon is for stashing changes (when clicking on the icon),
and shows the menu with the existing stashes when using the pull down.

The existing menu item in the repo view was also replaced by this
submenu.

Looks like this when there are no stashes yet:

* Stashes
  * Stash Changes...
  * -
  * (no stashed changes)

And like this with stashes:

* Stashes

  * -

a property tester that does the logic in code instead of XML.

To adjust the enabled checks of some actions, some selection-related

other duplicated logic for getting the repository obsolete.

widget style recomputation while hovering with the mouse over the diff

because each time style ranges are recomputed, they are also applied to
the widget in addDoneListenerToFormatJob().

This commit simply removes unneeded setStyle() calls from mouse hover

updates

The IndexDiffCacheEntry currently immediately schedules update jobs on
resource changes. Given a resource related task which affects multiple
resources in 'n' workspace changes (e.g. ""clean compile"" on n projects),
IndexDiffCacheEntry.scheduleUpdateJob() is called n times on same
repository, creating n jobs (which in worst case creates n threads in
Eclipse), running one after each other and creating n notifications on
completion. This significantly affects Eclipse UI performance on huge
git repositories.

To avoid this, one single (collecting resources) IndexDiffUpdateJob is
created and used per IndexDiffCacheEntry. On each resource change
pending changes are collected by this job, but instead of immediate
scheduling default delay of 400 milliseconds is used to schedule the
job. This reduces both memory consumption and overhead by reducing
notifications count to UI listeners.

Fixes various LocalRepositoryTestCase based tests, which were failing if
executed on NFS mount, see Bug 440182. The current workaround doesn't
really checks for NFS (have no idea how to do this in Java) but allows
tests running on ""/home"" to run ""delete"" cleanup twice (second ""delete""
round deletes unexpected nfs zombie files). The assumption is that this
workaround should at least help *nix users with their NFS mounted home
directories.

Ideally the tests should be fixed to properly cleanup opened .pack file
handles, but I've spent one day hunting the root cause on one single
test without success, due the asynchronous nature of the resources
creation/cleanup.

IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI(URI) method performs very

The fix tries first to get the direct workspace resources map hit by
using IWorkspaceRoot.getContainerForLocation(IPath) and only if this
fails, fail over to the slow findContainersForLocationURI method.

This works very fast for almost all cases (constant execution time) and
adds only a small overhead if the matching project/folder is contained
in a *closed* project which overlaps location of another *opened*
project.

The diff viewer is the same as in the ""Diff"" tab of the commit viewer.
It still shares its scroll bar with the message.

The advantage is that when a file is selected, only the diff has to be
updated, not the whole message. We can also make the commit message
collapsible or extract other parts from the comment (such as the list of
branches/tags). Also, the hyperlink detectors now only run on the commit
message, not on the diff.

When clicking amend and then switching to another branch, the amend
state and commit message would stay the same.

This change fixes it so that after switching to another branch, amend
and commit message are reset. I think this is less surprising than
keeping amend but updating the message.

The other hunk in this change is so that we still preserve the amend
state when switching to another repository and back.

By using setStyleRanges for the format job results first (which are
ordered and non-overlapping), we still get the better performance of
setting these in bulk. The hyperlink style ranges are then applied on
top to handle overlapping, but they should be much fewer in numbers.

Currently interactive rebase view plan toolbar can incorrectly handle
changeset table selection changes in case of multiple selected
changesets.
RebaseInteractiveStepActionToolBarProvider#mapActionItemsToSelection
activates corresponding button on the toolbar in case of single
selection and can deactivate all buttons in case on multi selection (if
selected changesets have different rebasing plans). Current
implementation does not handle situation in which another button needs
to be activated. For example, if previously selected changeset had
""reword"" plan (""reword"" button activated) and new selection is two
changesets with ""fixup"" plan then expected behaviour is to activate
""fixup"" button, but actually ""reword"" button will remain activated. 

Proposed implementation always activates button corresponding to the
first selected changeset plan and deactivates this button if necessary
(i.e. selected changesets have different plans).

To be consistent with other similar file viewers in Eclipse we should
avoid using alternate colors for simple file lists - they only add

Thread 2: In a job run, GitProvider.getData is called, which waits to
lock the GitProjectData class.

There are also other situations, all of which are caused by
logAndUnmapGoneMappedResource calling RepositoryProvider.unmap. By doing
that in a job where the GitProjectData class is no longer locked, this
should be solved.

See change I50b7c8c66cf391cf5c08b2a29e6bfd14896f17f6 for why.

The tables/trees in this change either have no colums or are very
simple, so the alternating row colors just add noise.

A ContainerTreeIterator always returned 0 as length of a directory. This
was inconsistent with JGits FileTreeIterator which asked the filesystem
object about the length. At least on unix filesystems the file-system
size of the directory was returned which was different from 0. On
Windows 0 was returned by java.io.File.
Because of this inconsistency folders containing submodules often have
been marked as dirty by mistake. The index was filled with data coming
from a FileTreeIterator (length!=0) while the ContainerTreeIterator
returned length==0.

This has been fixed by forcing ContainerTreeIterator to ask the
filesystem for the length of a folder.

setStyleRanges expects the ranges to be in order. Because UIUtils used a
set, they were not in order. But even if they're in order, hyperlink
detectors could still return overlapping results, so use individual
setStyleRange calls, which takes care of overlapping.

Apparently WTP does things differently than other editors. The default
selection object is not meaningful there, so extend the enablement
expression to check activeEditorInput as well.

Also, when executing the command, the selection object is both an
ITextSelection and an empty IStructuredSelection. By checking for
ITextSelection first, we get a result instead of an empty selection.

Creating a patch in format ""Eclipse Workspace"" sometimes does not work.
The wizard simply doesn't do anything. 

The issue happens in two cases:
1. One of the files in the commit is NOT contained in any Eclipse
project.
2. One of the files in the commit is contained in MORE THAN ONE Eclipse
project.

There is no reason not to create a patch in the second case. In fact it
doesn't matter from which project the file is considered.

The resulting patches didn't work with ""git apply"" because the trailing

Just removing the line with ""trim newline"" at the end wasn't enough,
because the ByteArrayOutputStream was only overriding one of the write
methods (not the one with just one char). So the last newline was never
added to the StringBuilder. Replace it with a more straightforward
implementation.

If the text extent height of a to be rendered plot line is odd, then the
SWTPlotRenderer cannot calculate the correct Y position for drawing the
label and draws the label with a 1 pixel offset. SWT text drawing uses
the baseline as Y coordinate. Due to the given centerline API in the
AbstractPlotRenderer the overall calculation of the baseline for SWT is
effectively (height / 2) * 2, thereby rounding all odd heights downward
to the next even number.

This change pushes the division by 2 from the caller into the
implementations of drawText.

In addition, enabling antialiasing has been moved from the
SWTPlotRenderer to the CommitGraphTable itself. Otherwise the cell label
heights are calculated different (1 pixel more height with antialiasing
enabled) in the middle of painting a row. This issue seems to be
specific to Windows.

Changes have been tested on Ubuntu14.10/GTK and Windows 7.

The commit message and the amend state were cleared after repository
refreshes while amending. Now both is usually preserved and cleared only
if the underlying amended commit changed, e.g. because the user switched
to another branch.

We now also remember the commit message and that amend was enabled when
the Staging View or Eclipse as a whole is closed.

Current isActive() code calls into UI thread but can be called itself
from long running low level egit jobs via
IndexChangedListener.onIndexChanged(), so it is can cause deadlock
situations between UI/job threads.

The patch avoids calling into the UI thread directly and introduces new
""uiIsActive"" field to track window activation and deactivation via
already existing IWindowListener callbacks.

Changes to ignored resources cause deltas fired by eclipse. These deltas
will cause index update jobs even though there is nothing to do. In the
worst case, a lot of resources are changed, and even though nothing
happened to tracked files, a full re-index is done because the changed
resource count threshold was reached.

The fix for bug 417597 (https://git.eclipse.org/r/30261) can cause
performance problems for slow workspaces where *lot* of changes were
reported but the incremental index update is not fast enough.

Because the changes are collected until the previous job is done, if the
number of changes exceeds RESOURCE_LIST_UPDATE_LIMIT (1000) the full
index update will be triggered which costs even more time.

The proposed fix is to decrease the IndexDiffUpdateJob start delay from
400 to 10 ms, with the hope that this will help slow workspaces to
perform updates faster.

If the staging view is linked to the selected resource and if that
resource belongs to a submodule then staging view should also run in
the context of the submodule repo. This allows to work with submodules
in a similar manner than with native git. If I want to do a commit in a
submodule repo then select a resource in that submodule repo and you can
use Staging view to prepare the commit in the submodule repo. In native
git you would ""cd"" to a folder containing a file from the submodule to
switch context from the containing repo to the submodule repo. In EGit
you have to select a resource from the submodule to achieve the same.

RepositoryMapping is enhanced by one method which can return a submodule
repository. In future RepositoryMapping could be further enhanced to 
support git submodules in general.

Always check if the number of changed files exceeds the magic limit for
incremental index updates. In case of huge repositories with lot of
ignored files (> 65000) the incremental merge of ignored lists can be
highly inefficient if the number of changed files is higher then 2000.

Added tests for job scheduling to make sure reload and update are used
as expected.

If we are linked, each time IndexDiffUpdateJob starts, indicate that the
view is busy (e.g. reload() will trigger this job in background!).

This is not the best solution if one has many repositories: on Eclipse
startup the view could be shown busy even if the right repository is
already updated, but practically it works fine. 

Usually one has not really many *huge* repositories in the same Eclipse
workspace which can delay startup for long time, and after startup is
done, index refresh usually happens for the current repository only
because index diff updates are started only on repositories where user
makes some changes or selects elements.

Just seen that ""Compare with Previous"" will fail on Eclipse 3.8 due some
bugs in HandlerUtil, if executed on a file which last version is a merge
version.

In this case we open selection dialog (which commit to use for diff),
and this makes the ""active window"" variable disappear. The simple fix is
to read the variable before we open a dialog.

The ""Target Platform Definition DSL and Generator"" [1] heavily
simplifies maintenance of target platforms. It allows to modularize
target platform definitions which eliminates code duplication. The
.target files understood by P2 and Tycho are generated from .tpd files
which are written in the target platform definition DSL.

In order to edit .tpd files and generate .target files install the
""Target Platform Definition DSL and Generator"" 2.0 or later [2]  (Note:
on Kepler you also need to add [3] to get Xtext 2.5 which is not
available by default on Kepler). This tools is needed only if you need
to change the Target Platform definition files (*.targetplatform and
*.tpd) and re-generate the *.target files. In normal development you do
not need this and can simply use the generated *.target themselves.

In addition
- update Orbit repository for 4.5 to Mars M5
- use latest released Orbit p2 repository for platform version Luna
  and earlier
- update hamcrest to 1.3 which is used by swtbot on newer platform
  versions
- update p2f file

- add dependency to org.eclipse.e4.rcp otherwise workbench UI doesn't 
  come up during UI tests
- remove Mac 32 bit OS platform which is no longer supported in Mars
- avoid specifying version range for platform version, we already use a 
  target platform to specify that, having a second redundant way to 
  specify platform version is error prone.

hosted by a Gerrit server. In that case auto-configure the repository
for Gerrit. Configure the push refspec to HEAD:refs/for/master which
should be ok in most cases.

A repository might be moved on the file system by a user and a symbolic
link in the tree structure might be put in place to allow old references
to resolve. However, after such an action EGit fails to remove the old
path because it only looks for canonical path. The canonical path is
different after such a move.

Allow model providers to use remote information when trying
to determine whether a file is a part of a logical model or
not. When a file has been deleted locally, or when a file
has been created on one of the remote sides, the local side
is not enough to compute a full model. ModelProviders will
need access to the remote file data to take these ""unknown""
files into account.

IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI(URI) and
findFilesForLocationURI(URI) methods performs very poor on big
repositories and workspaces, and gets even worse with lot of links in
the workspace too. Example is the staging view with 2000 changes files
on a huge workspace - updating the index is faster then updating the
staging view which uses ResourceUtil!

The fix tries first to get the direct workspace resources map hit by
using IWorkspaceRoot.get*ForLocation(IPath) and only if this
fails, fail over to the slow find*ForLocationURI methods.

This works very fast for almost all cases (constant execution time) and
adds only a small overhead if the matching project/folder is contained
in a *closed* project which overlaps location of another *opened*
project.

See also similar fix in IteratorService (bug 440722 commit
d3a78e05381ff38370ba6a6a1d6733d741d15f45).

IEditorRegistry uses Program.findProgram() for file types ""unknown"" to
Eclipse. Unfortunately Program.findProgram() is platform dependent,
requires the caller to run in UI thread and on some platforms can be
really slow => in worst case multiple calls to retrieve image
descriptors via this API will block Eclipse UI for a long time. This
happens e.g. in the History view for commits with thousands of files or
in the Staging view with thousands of staged or unstaged files.

The proposed solution first checks if the editor is external or not, and
than uses a cache for *external* editor image descriptors, which avoids
(for files with the same extension) multiple native calls from UI thread
via IEditorRegistry.getImageDescriptor().

CBI recently fixed a couple of resource leaks which probably caused
jar signing failures on Hudson (bug 464947). JGit builds were also
affected. Hence use version 1.1.2-SNAPSHOT until a new release is
available. Remove dash's eclipse-signing-maven-plugin which we don't
use anymore since a while.

When given a selection the GenericHistoryView only considers the first
element and adapts it to an IResource before passing it on as input. To
work around this behavior the GitHistoryPage now looks at the current
selection itself and uses it as input if preferable.

The ""Push Branch..."" wizard suggested a wrong target branch name
prefixed with the remote's name if the selected source branch was a
remote tracking branch. Pushing from a remote tracking branch to the
remote branch it's tracking is pointless. So there's no natural
candidate for the target branch. Hence do not suggest any target branch
if pushing a remote tracking branch.

Also improve texts in PushBranchPage to make them easier to understand.

running task. This causes SWTBot to give up closing the wizard shell,
but after the timeout of one minute, for each test running after the
current one => the execution will be aborted after 40 minutes timeout.

So before trying to validate search result, give the wizard operation a
chance to complete!

If the push URI already is ssh, it most likely already has a port,
and if the user cloned the repo from Gerrit, it will even be correct.
Replacing that by Gerrit's default ssh port of 29418 is most confusing
if that Gerrit runs its sshd on a non-standard port.

ResourceRefreshJob is triggered each time user activates Eclipse window,
even if there are no Git configured projects in the workspace and no
changes in configured Git repositories.

Unfortunately even if the job detects that it has nothing to do, it
*always* triggers workspace change events and autobuild job executions.
ResourceRefreshJob is a subclass of InternalWorkspaceJob, so just via
entering runInWorkspace() method a sequence of calls below is always
executed:

workspace.prepareOperation()
workspace.beginOperation()
workspace.endOperation()

The last one always dispatches ResourceChangeEvent to all
IResourceChangeListener's and so triggers also auto build job (which
usually simply doesn't do anything). Although I have no example how it
can cause real harm in production environment, alone debugging the build
process in Eclipse is impossible because of permanent interruptions from
ResourceRefreshJob.

RepositoriesViewSorter re-implemented sorting of nodes which is already
implemented in RepositoryTreeNode in a naïve way. Instead delegate the
comparison to RepositoryNode.compare().

Also improve RepositoryNode.compare() using CommonUtil comparators which
ensure that sorting is case-insensitive and sort names containing
numbers in natural order. This ensures all objects shown in the
repositories view are sorted accordingly.

This also fixes the problem that since b9dad5fa the order of repository
nodes flipped when its status became dirty/clean. This was caused by
RepositoriesViewSorter which compared the node label texts which changes
when the dirty decorator ""> "" is added or removed.

This is first and foremost a syntax coloring problem, and should be
handled as such. This change implements that:

* Adds a token scanner that recognizes hyperlinks using the configured
  hyperlink detectors.
* Adds a presentation reconciler with a damager/repairer that uses this
  token scanner.
* Gets rid of the overridden hideHyperlinks() method -- if we do proper
  document partitioning, this definitely wrecks havoc.
* Uses SWT.UNDERLINE_LINK to style hyperlink partitions.
* Adds a few unit tests for the tokenizing.
* Adds org.objenesis to required bundles in org.eclipse.egit.ui.test
  to enable mocking.

In my manual UI tests, this syntax-colors hyperlinks nicely in the
staging view, spell-checking works, auto-wrap works, whitespace display
works, the ""hand"" pointer appears only over hyperlinks, and bug 471355
is solved. It also has no adverse effects on the commit viewer or the
git history view.

The goal is to get the commit message viewer in the git history view to
use the same (configurable) hyperlink colors and other hyperlink
infrastructure as the SpellcheckableMessageArea. This is complicated by
two things:

* custom hyperlinks to commits with custom opening, and
* no clear model-view separation; getting the data from git,
  formatting, and coloring were all lumped together.

Therefore, improve the model-view separation:

* Get rid of hand-crafted SWT text range coloring. CommitInfoBuilder is
  restricted to getting the data from the repo, formatting, and
  returning semantic information (hyperlinks, header and footer
  ranges). It doesn't do syntax-coloring anymore.
* CommitMessageViewer uses a partitioning on its document to split it
  logically into header, body, and footer. It also gets a custom
  hyperlink detector to deal with the custom commit hyperlinks.
* GitHistoryPage uses a presentation reconciler with damager/repairers
  that know how to syntax-color each partition (and hyperlinks).
* Made the HyperlinkTokenScanner a bit more flexible to rebuild the
  italicizing of Signed-off-by footer lines. Fixed a bug along the way
  (if ""fill paragraphs"" was on, it would put footer lines onto one
  line).

Visually, there are no changes except the colors of hyperlinks, which
now follow SpellcheckableMessageArea and are configurable.

My initial implementation of this was too inefficient. It invoked the
HyperlinkDetectors for every character, which effectively re-introduced
bug 415537 and made editing long commit messages with only a few links
a pain.

Therefore, compute all hyperlinks on a line and cache them once
computed. Use this cache while we're on that line, and re-compute it
when the current position passes to a new line.

Add an internal subclass of the standard URL hyperlink detector
org.eclipse.jface.text.hyperlink.URLHyperlinkDetector because that one
is only capable of finding hyperlinks at the start of the region.
Others, like those from mylyn, do find all links in a region on their
own.

This is a follow up on https://git.eclipse.org/r/54672.

If Staging view was opened without selecting any repository, changing
any preference in any of the Git preference pages caused NPE in
IndexDiffCache.getIndexDiffCacheEntry(Repository).

Marked currentRepository field as Nullable and fixed all other possible
NPE places. 

Enabled org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.nullUncheckedConversion to
show warnings if a value with unknown nullness is used where a NonNull
value is required.

Part 1: UI and use it in history view.

* New DateFormatPreferencePage.
* New UI preferences.
* New PreferenceBasedDateFormatter.
* Changed all uses of GitDateFormatter and DateFormat to use the new
  PreferenceBasedDateFormatter.
* The only fixed format is ISO for the hovers in commit graph tables.

Some implementation notes:
* The default format is the custom format (already existing DATE_FORMAT
  preference. Reasons: this is a reasonable (local) format, and if
  the user had configured something there, it will still be used. Keep
  surprises for the user at a minimum.
* PreferenceBasedDateFormatter is a subtype of GitDateFormatter to keep
  changes at a minimum. It also helps in the views where the user can
  explicitly force RELATIVE dates.
* The old date format (under ""Label Decorations/Other/DateFormat"")
  preference UI has been removed.
* Where we use label providers, make those listen to preference changes
  related to their labels (dates, showing e-mails), not the viewers.
  The label providers fire an event when their state changes, users
  can just listen on those events. Limits the proliferation of checking
  specific preferences, and simplifies some code.
* Otherwise, views or viewers refresh on date format preference
  changes.
* This commit also fixes
   - bug 339797 (custom format for date column in history view),
   - bug 477151 (preference page silently ignores incorrect date
     formats)

Currently Eclipse resources API offers the choice of having very fast
but unpredictable results (getFileForLocation()) or very slow but
deterministic (findFilesForLocationURI()) while requesting a file via
IPath key in context of nested projects. The ""unpredictability"" of the
fast API is not documented and has side effects only if workspace
contains nested projects - in this case if the file is located in many
projects, it is not guaranteed, file handle from which project will be
returned (it is related to project names, see bug 476585).

During the fix for bug 440722, by choosing the very fast file lookup for
ResourceUtil we unintentionally changed the EGit behavior so that in
case nested projects were involved, EGit sometimes could not use the
file from the inner most project, but from parent one.

This fix offers an explicit option for clients which would prefer to see
resources from inner most projects independently how long it takes to
resolve them. Some of the affected ResourceUtil API clients are changed
to always request files inner most projects: mostly editor/compare
related code.

This resolves a TODO in RebaseInteractiveView: if the dynamic columns
need less space than available horizontally, there will be be a large
unused empty space at the right. Can happen if the view is wide, or
commit messages are short, or for instance also in the view is opened
without input (just open it via the quick access).

The solution is to redistribute all available space after pack() using
a TreeColumnLayout with ColumnWeightData and the sizes obtained after
packing.

As a result, the table uses at least all the available horizontal space
and may (as before) use more if the columns don't fit (which then gives
a horizontal scroll bar, also as before).

* Give the directory text input a reasonable minimum width to
  improve the behavior when the dialog is resized ridiculously small.
* Limit the two groups' sizes to at least the sizes of their content.
* Remove the initial miminum height on the tree once it's filled.

Somehow this minimum height setting caused the disappearing scrollbar.
However, if it is removed altogether, the dialog comes up with a tree
that is way too small. Therefore, do set initially a minimum height so
that the dialog as a whole gets a reasonable size, and then remove the
minimum later on.

We have _no_ foolproof way to correctly compare paths:

* IPath treats paths always case-insensitively, both in equals()
  and in isPrefixOf(), which can give rise to unexpected problems
  on case-insensitive file systems such as NTFS on Windows or HFS+
  on OS X.
* java.io.File considers HFS+ (Mac) a case-sensitive UnixFileSystem,
  which is incorrect. (HFS+ can be either, and by default on Macs
  is case-insensitive.) On Windows, File is indeed case-insensitive.
* java.nio.file.Path also uses a case-sensitive sun.nio.fs.UnixPath
  on HFS+. On Windows, it is case-insensitive.
* org.eclipse.jgit.util.FS_POSIX.isCaseSensitive() returns
  unconditionally false for Macs. However, HFS+ partitions _can_ be
  case-sensitive. Furthermore, org.eclipse.jgit.util.FS doesn't have
  operations for case-normalization.
* org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Project sets the project location
  to the canonicalized file path. File.getCanonicalFile() does appear
  to normalize capitalization to the form actually used in the file
  system.
* Many places in EGit do path comparisons between Eclipse IResources
  and git working trees using any of the possibilities above.
  
Options to fix this are:
* Use java.io.File or java.nio.file.Path, but that would leave HFS+ out
  in the cold. Would require lots of changes throughout EGit to root
  out any uses of comparisons via IPath.
* Write our own comparison and prefix methods. Make sure only those are
  used. Any collections storing paths or files would need to be checked
  and adapted; or maybe we'd even need or own subclass of File...
* Ensure that we use for repositories only the canonical path, like
  Eclipse core does for IProjects, so that the same casing is used.

This change implements the latter. It ensures that EGit and the
Eclipse resource tree both have the same idea of where things are and
should thus resolve most case-sensitivity problems, even if IPath is
used.

In commit 2f9171f we started using the canonical path for repositories
because org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Project uses that, so that
EGit and the Eclipse resource tree have the same idea of where projects
are. Otherwise EGit did not detect all projects belonging to a
repository.

However, this broke the detection of already imported repositories in
the RespositorySearchDialog. I had missed that because this dialog uses
always case-sensitive string comparisons for file paths, but none of
the other usual methods to compare paths (IPath, File, Path).

To fix this, we now compare both the absolute path (as before) _and_
the canonical path. This correctly catches both repositories added with
a non-canonical path as well as repositories added with a canonical
path.

The display has been left unchanged; I considered it too confusing
for the user if he entered a directory, but the list would display
potentially different canonical paths. Also resetting the directory
input to the canonical path might have been rather surprising.

As far as I see this is the only place in EGit UI where plain strings
are used as paths.

The IndexDiffCache relies on IResourceChangeEvents to update itself

the staging view on an unstaged file that doesn't belong to an open
project, there are no IResourceChangeEvents, and since the file is
unstaged, there is no IndexChangeEvent either. So we need to trigger

To solve bug 481682, we'll use a LocalNonWorkspaceTypedElement to show
a diff on a file not in any open Eclipse project. The super class
implements isSynchronized() only for accessible workspace resources via
the Eclipse resource tree. We need to handle it ourselves here,
otherwise any attempt to save from the compare editor will pop up a
dialog falsely claiming the file had been modified outside of the
compare editor.

The implementation is closely modeled after the one in the super class,
but using the file system's last-modified timestamp directly instead of
going through the Eclipse resource tree, which would always give -1L
for such inaccessible resources.

StagingEntry in the StagingView and to open the compare editor even if

If we can't get IResource adapter from current editor, IURIEditorInput
is our last resort. It is implemented by FileStoreEditorInput which is
used by Eclipse for editing files which are located outside workspace.

If the URI returned by the IURIEditorInput represents a valid file path,
we can check if we have a repository for this path even if it is not in
the workspace.

Added adapters from IURIEditorInput to java.io.File, Repository and
IHistoryPageSource and updated Repository, Staging and History views so
that they can show their specific content for active external editor.

* Make SelectionUtils.getRepository() keep going as long as all
  RepositorMappings are null, so that it does consider adapters.
  Previously, it returned null upon the first null mapping.
  (RepositoryMapping assumes paths to correspond to an accessible
  workspace IResource -- i.e., works only for files in open Eclipse
  projects.)
* Since RepositoryMapping.getMapping() only returns something for
  resources in open projects, give the LocalNonWorkspaceTypedElement
  the known repository directly. Also, StagingEntry must adapt to
  accessible resources only.
* Fix dirty state handling in GitCompareFileRevisionEditorInput.

This makes diffs from the staging view work even for files
that are in closed projects, or in no project at all (i.e., Eclipse
project removed from workspace, or a file in the git repo outside of
any project, such as a global .gitignore).

For whatever reason Staging view has a menu called ""Open Workspace

viewers don't care if the file is inside or outside the workspace and
open the requested file in editor. Staging view should just do the same.
There is no reason to restrict opening files to the workspace located

Funny enough, even if the other viewers were allowing opening of
external files, they reused the menu text from the Staging view. Changed
the menu to ""Open Working Tree Version"" to be consistent what it really
does.

Repository view used a different but very similar implementation for
opening editors as Staging view. The difference is that the Staging view
always opened default text editor on external files, and Repository view
allows IDE decide which editor is more suitable. The later one is better
because user will usually get the right editor for the file (e.g. Java
editor for *.java with syntax coloring etc) and also can configure which
editor should be used for specific file type.

The best example I've seen why the code should never ever use
conditional expressions without curly braces. The missing braces and
wrong else block indentation suggested that the ""ignoreLine"" should be
prepended with a new line in case the file already exists and does not
ends with a new line. The reality was that the ""else"" block was
following not the first but the second ""if"", and so the code never did
what requested and ignore file was corrupted with a new ignore rule
added on the same line as the last ignore rule. OMG!

To reproduce, create an ignore file which ends with an ignore rule
without terminating new line. Make sure the files to ignore are outside
the workspace and try to ignore them from the repositories view.

A GitModelObject returns the full absolute path to the object in the git
working tree. Using that for IWorkspaceRoot.getFile() creates a resource
with that as path, not as location. Which result in all deleted
resources having bogus paths in the Git Model of the Synchronize View.

This change maps back the git absolute path to a workspace-relative path
that can then safely be used with IWorkspaceRoot.getFile().

Adapting a GitModelObject to an IResource will work only for files
actually in the Eclipse workspace. Changing that so that it works also
for files in the working tree, but not in the workspace is _not_ fixed
by this change.

When a repository is removed, it was never removed from the
IndexDiffCache, which in fact has no operation to remove anything. Only
the preference in ResourceUtil is updated. This of course in turn means
there's a hard reference in IndexDiffCache to the repo, and it thus also
remains in the RepositoryCache indefinitely (unless it is really
deleted, not just removed from the view).

Clean this up:

1. IndexDiffCache listens on changes to the preference storing the
   configured repositories and removes any stale cache entries upon
   changes.
2. Individual cache entries really clear all listeners, and cancel
   their jobs when disposed.
3. The RepositoryCache also listens on that preference and also removes
   stale entries proactively. Using weak references is a nice touch,
   but relying on the GC to clean up is not really necessary here.

The ResourceStateFactory must not rely exclusively on the ResourceCache
to find repositories. That cache is not guaranteed to contain all
configured repositories at all times. Only while the repository view is
open we can rely on the cache to contain all configured repositories.

Instead, use RepositoryMapping.getMapping, and fall back to the cache
only when that doesn't find anything.

This is a general problem with this cache. The RepositoryCache is
populated by three code paths:

* RepositoryMapping.getMapping() -- on-demand-load; no hard reference
  is retained permanently in general.
* Auto-sharing in the core Activator -- on-demand-load; no hard
  reference is retained permanently.
* The content provider of the Repositories View -- full load; hard
  reference kept as long as the view is open.

The fix here is minimal. A more complete fix would be to make
RepositoryCache.getRepository(IPath) demand-load missing configured
repositories. I _do_ have an implementation for that, too, but that
needs more testing.

The GitFlow property tester tests the presence of certain values in the
git config. Accessing the git config incurs three file accesses to get
the last-modified times of the system, user, and repo config files to
determine whether they have changed, and if so, to reload them. These
are potentially slow operations involving file I/O. Even just getting
the last-modified time apparently can be expensive, for instance if the
user config is on a non-local file system.

The GitFlow property testers were based on the current selection and
thus were re-evaluated by the Eclipse framework whenever the current
selection changed, including text selections. The text selection may
change on each keypress. This could lead to very noticeable delays if
access to the last-modified time of a config file was slow.

I don't see an easy way to improve the handling of config files. The
other approach to minimize the overhead of property testers is to
minimize the number of times they're re-evaluated. Since the GitFlow
property testers are not really interested in the current selection
but in a derived property of that (the current repository), this
change provides this current repository as a variable in the
IEvaluationContext and makes the property tester use that new variable.
As a result, the tests are only re-evaluated when the current selection
changes such that the current repository changes. Keypresses and text
selection changes in an editor no longer trigger re-evaluations of the
GitFlow property tests.

The current repository is still determined on each selection change.
However,

* this is normally a relatively fast operation as the repository is
  already cached most of the time, 
* the repository is determined only once in the source provider instead
  of again and again in each property test.

Accessing persistent properties may be expensive, and may block if
other threads manipulate the same persistent property bucket. (For
instance, JDT initialization does set persistent properties for source
attachments.)

Therefore, if we didn't find a GitProvider through the session property,
let's first check whether the project is already scheduled for mapping
in the MappingJob. If so, we do know:

* the project is indeed a Git project (some thread tested the persistent
  property already), and
* we don't need to test the persistent property again, and
* we don't need to try to schedule the project for mapping again.

This should significantly reduce the number of accesses to that
persistent property for projects that indeed have a GitProvider.

To reduce the number of persistent property accesses for unshared
projects, re-implement part of the corresponding logic in
RepositoryProvider, which is unfortunately private. Note: this works
because mapping a repository provider creates the session property
first, and we reset our own ""marked as unshared"" property whenever we
do find a provider (any one will do).

introduced in commit 39f3c68.

Remove the tests for HTTP protocols. They are allowed anyway by the
general test that the clipboard content ends in .git.

Also consider only clipboard content up to the first whitespace (after
having removed a potential ""git clone"" prefix). Formerly, we stopped at
the first blank, not general whitespace, and would thus autofill even
with multi-line clipboard content like

  foobar
  baz
  .git

(No blank in there, just line endings.)

Finally, add missing braces and remove a spurious trim() call.

Commit 4e89050 inadvertently introduced the restriction that all
resources in the selection be in one repository. However, AddToIndex,
RemoveFromIndex, and Ignore previously also worked if projects from
different repositories were selected.

Remove the restriction on a single repository from the
ResourceStatePropertyTester, and simplify the isEnabled() of AddToIndex
and RemoveFromIndex action handlers a bit.

The ResourceStatePropertyTester is currently used only for these
commands in the Team context menu. If is ever to be used with some
command for which all resources really must be from one repository, it
can be combined with the ""resourcesSingleRepository"" property test.

Performance should not suffer as all repository or index diff operations
in the property tester operate on caches.

Add new tests to test the ""Add To Index"" and ""Remove From Index"" actions
for single and multiple repository selections.

Also, it makes no sense to log an error in RepositoryFinder when
getLocation() == null. That doesn't necessarily mean the resource
didn't exist; it could be provided through an EFS. This is true for
projects as well other resources (the RepositoryFinder might consider
linked resources, and those might be linked through an EFS.)

EGit, like other team providers, cannot really deal with EFSs.

The test was looking for a tree node with label ""GeneralProject"". As
the screenshot from unstable build 8131[1] clearly shows, the node is
labeled ""> GeneralProject"".

Looks like there's some asynchronous decoration going on, and depending
on whether the test tried to get the node before or after the decorator
ran it would succeed or fail.

Remedy by using TestUtil.getNode(), which only requires a substring
match, instead of SWTBotTreeItem.getNode(), which requires an exact
match. Also relax the assertion on the ""<working tree>"" node (same as
in the following test method).

There may be more similar problem spots lurking in here.

Test failure in [1] claimed that no refresh job was scheduled.

The RepositoriesView schedules a refresh on its own in response to an
index diff change. If a refresh job is already scheduled and not
running yet, the re-schedule in view.refresh() has no effect. See
JobManager.schedule(). As a result, the JobListener is never notified
about a scheduled job.

Moreover, if the job is already running, re-scheduling will make it run
again, but the JobListener will return already when the currently
running job finishes.

Therefore, we first need to join() potentially already scheduled
refresh jobs to be sure that view.refresh() really schedules a job
that we can then wait for.

org.eclipse.resources.Path.fromOSString normalizes paths. However, the
FileRepositoryBuilder returns paths like
/some/path/container/../.git/modules/... . If that get's normalized, we
end up with /some/path/.git/modules/... , which defeats the subsequent
attempt to relativize the string to ../.git/modules/... .

Using java.nio.file.Path, we can avoid this premature normalization,
and moreover we can create relative paths in way more cases.

Most of the basic plumbing for this was already in place, but it looks
as if the implementation was never really finished. For instance,
GitProjectData is prepared to record RepositoryMApping on container
level, not just for projects. The feature was just not used, and many
places in EGit make assumptions that imply that a project is fully
within one repository. This is a first commit to get rid of this
assumption, and to properly deal with submodules that exist only as
folders in the Eclipse workspace.

Augment the already existing resource change listener in GitProjectData
to also handle additions of DOT_GIT resources. In that way it'll pick
up submodules as they appear in the Eclipse resource tree.

RepositoryMapping.getMapping(IResource) must consider mappings
entered for folders below the project level. One mustn't jump directly
to project level; that will skip any submodules that might have been
applicable.

StagingView: no need anymore to use a submodule walk. The
RepositoryMapping for any resource will point to the correct
repository, even if it's a submodule. Not using a submodule walk also
avoids problem with the walk returning non-normalized git directory
paths that may contain "".."" segments, while our RepositoryCache uses
normalized paths. This might lead to us having two versions of the
same repo in the cache, and listening for index diff changes on one
wouldn't trigger on the other.

GitResourceDeltaVisitor: must descend into folders even if the
repository doesn't match on project level. Otherwise submodules are not
updated.

Deprecated:
* RepositoryMapping.getSubmoduleRepository(IResource)

Also changed some uses of RepositoryMapping.getMapping(IProject) to
RepositoryMapping.getMapping(IResource). I'd like to have deprecated
the project variant, but this needs more careful analysis of the
remaining places its used.

Properly adding submodule mappings and considering them fixes at least
bug 446344, comment 11. Also related is bug 401556, though that was
reported for the behavior in the Repositories view, which isn't fixed by
this commit yet. However, a selection in the project explorer for a
folder belonging to a submodule showed the same erroneous behavior.

New tests added.

The fixes are going to support nested repositories in one project and
the submodule fixes are ""only"" related to this, because they are nested
repos too. I've not planned to fix submodules first, but we are
investigating to use them later.

For adding nested Git repos we use ""links"", so the sub-repos are not
located in the ""projects root git repo"" directly, they are only linked
there. Additionally we use ""worktree add"" and i've updated JGit to
proposed solution (see #477475) and have small fix in EGit too
(https://git.eclipse.org/r/67223).

My changes are work-in-progress, TODOs:
- automatic tests (have tested it with some manually created repos and
eclipse projects)
  - for submodules
  - nested repos
- the nested repos are detected during project import only, so during
refresh etc. mapping is not updated
- Submodule-Walk does not fit to RepositoryMapping concept as i
understand --> remove / replace with other compatible solution

Requires that the RepositoryCache ensures that all repositories are
registered under their normalized git directory file name (normalized
meaning not containing . or .. components). The
RepositoriesViewContentProvider uses a SubmoduleWalk, and that returns
non-normalized paths, while the RepositoryMappings always use normalized
ones. That results in two different repository instances for the same
git repository; listening for index diff changes on one won't trigger on
the other one, and thus labels in the repositories view wouldn't update.

RepositoryCache cleanup must make sure not to remove submodules and
nested modules prematurely. Since those are not registered as
""configured repositories"", which would cause trouble when a repo was
deleted from the Repositories view anyway, we must make sure to remove
them only if no configured repository contains them.

This requires that the RepositoryCache keeps track of repository
nesting. To avoid duplicating code, the IndexDiffCache cleanup when a
configured repository is removed is now triggered from the
RepositoryCache.

The recursive search did not detected working tree with .git file in

it worked fine. Now it first checks the selected root folder and then
looks in sub-folders if selected. The Git private folders like .git
folder itself are not traversed anymore.

This prepares EGit to still properly detect git repositories when
JGit change ""https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67873/"" adds the evaluation
of "".git"" file with ""gitdir"" link to worktree and evaluates commondir.

Follow-up to commit a8bcee9.

When a previously connected, then disconnected project is re-connected,
there is no resource change event. Thus the GitProjectData doesn't pick
up inner repositories, and doesn't re-set the RepositoryMappings for
folders inside the project that contain submodule or nested repository
working trees.

Because of another bug that I plan to fix soon (disconnecting a project
does not remove the RepositoryMapping session properties), this problem
is currently only visible if one quits and restarts Eclipse after having
disconnected. (Otherwise, the previous session properties are still set,
and everything appears fine.)

Thus we need to make sure when a project is shared that we get at least
a resource delta including all .git files and folders in the hierarchy.
Ensure that by touching all such inner resources.

Also, the SharingWizard must not suppress the refresh.

It's possible that an IndexDiffCacheEntry is disposed while an

join on it. We do, however, null out the previous IndexDiffData. A still
running job therefore needs to be careful about using this property.

If a connection failure occurs during the change number content assist,
the user feedback was poor. Some quick flickering of the progress bar
and that was it. The error log contained a stack trace starting with two
InvocationTargetExceptions without exception messages, which isn't
exactly helpful either.

Improve this in two ways:

* Generally skip InvocationTargetExceptions with empty messages when
  reporting or logging errors.
* In the case of the content proposal in the FetchGerritChangePage,
  show the error to the user.

Disconnecting a project left the session properties for the
RepositoryMappings still attached to the resource info in the Eclipse
resource tree.

This prevents timely garbage collection of no longer used repository
instances because the mappings contain hard references to repositories.

Moreover, potentially stale properties might become active again when
the project is re-connected.

When switching between gerrit enabled and non gerrit enabled
repositories, the 'commit and push' button adds an icon, but does not
resize, therefore the label does not fit into the button width.

This could be fixed by always resizing the parent area containing the
buttons when switching between gerrit and non gerrit repositories, but
that would lead to the button width changing every time and the left
border of the buttons jumping around.

The only solution with correct size and without buttons visibly resizing
therefore seems to have an icon on the button both for the gerrit and
the non gerrit use case. I've taken the normal ""Push"" icon, since there
is no ready made icon with the meaning of both commit and push.

the listeners only if they had indeed been created.

Up to now the user could not delete the branch hierarchy nodes. For
gerrit users this is a pain when trying to mass delete gerrit branches
with hierarchical layout being active.

The change expands the menu visibility, property testing and the
deletion command to explicitly handle the hierarchy branch nodes. A new
method has been introduced to get all refs of the hierarchy nodes
recursively. The deletion command then handles this list of refs,
instead of only taking one ref per selected node.

Overlapping selections (of branch nodes and their parent branch
hierarchy nodes) are handled correctly, because of the Set

Sometimes tests do not find children of expanded tree nodes. The root
cause appears to be that expand() expands the node in an asyncExec.[1]

Add a utility operation that after expanding waits until the desired
node exists, and replace all calls to expand() that do expect children
by that.

This should fix the issue that we can have multiple GitHistoryPage
instances for same repository created and held by GenericHistoryView.

The code in PageBookView.getPageRec(IWorkbenchPart) uses map with the
part as a key to get appropriate page instance. In case an existing page
is not found, the
GenericHistoryView.showHistoryPageFor(Object,
boolean, boolean, IHistoryPageSource) creates a new ""dummy""
HistoryPageSourceWorkbenchPart, which was used as a key in the map
above. In the hashCode() and equals() methods the
HistoryPageSourceWorkbenchPart uses hashCode() and equals() methods from
IHistoryPageSource instances. Previously it could happen that multiple
GitHistoryPageSource instances were created by the GitAdapterFactory
because the factory instances are created for each adapter contribution
in the plugin.xml, so that GitHistoryPageSource instances returned from
different GitAdapterFactory instances were different.

With different GitHistoryPageSource instances the
HistoryPageSourceWorkbenchPart keys were always different (even for the
same repository/file), the ""old"" existing GitHistoryPage instances were
not found, new pages were created by GenericHistoryView and old pages
left in memory (until closing the history view).

Give the user a nicer way to define a topic when pushing to Gerrit.
Previously, a topic could be set only by appending ""/<topic>"" or
""%topic=<topic>"" to the Gerrit branch.

Add a new text field for the topic, plus a new checkbox to select
whether a topic should be set at all.

State of both fields is persisted per local branch and restored when
the dialog is re-opened. This information is stored in the git config:

  [branch ""someLocalBranch""]
    gerritTopicUse = [true, false]
    gerritTopic = <topic>

Topics must follow a few rules:
* they must not contain whitespace.
* they must not contain both commas and percent signs (either one is
  fine, though).
This is because of Gerrit restrictions. The page does validate the topic
field and prevents pushing if an invalid topic is specified (and ""Use
topic"" is selected).

If no topic is defined explicitly, it defaults to the local branch name.
Setting a topic explicitly overrides a possible topic specification
given in the branch field. If ""Use topic"" is selected and the topic
field is empty, the topic at Gerrit is cleared.

The topic field provides content assist listing the last 20 valid topics
used for the repository.

When manually editing the URI of a remote, the automatic synchronization
of the URI and the remaining fields of the dialog (host, protocol, repo
etc.) leads to a wrong cursor position after each character being typed
by the user.

We avoid this by checking if the update of the URI is a no-op.

This fix applies for both the remote configuration dialog as well as the
clone wizard since they share the page with the implementation.

org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport must override a possibly already
installed org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer fragment. Since old importer
fragments were lacking a host bundle version constraint, they might
otherwise be active even after an update and then cause conflicting
requirements, leading to a failure to resolve and activate the
org.eclipse.egit.ui bundle.

Determining whether a refspec is for Gerrit must be in synch with the
ResourcePropertyTester. Moreover, fetch and push refspecs must be
considered separately.

With that in place, add new properties to the property tester:
canFetchFromGerrit and canPushToGerrit. Use these properties to
determine visibility of the ""Push to Gerrit..."" and ""Fetch from
Gerrit..."" commands such that they are visible only if they can be
performed.

When a user cloned a repository via git:// and then configured the
remote for Gerrit through ""Gerrit Configuration..."" (specifying a
ssh:// push URI), the ""Push to Gerrit..."" wizard would still open with
the git:// URI pre-selected because the dialog hadn't remembered any
""last used"" URI yet and ""git://"" is lexicographically smaller than
""ssh://"". This was counter-intuitive.

Therefore: if a remote is configured for Gerrit, or a push or fetch
refspec is configured (and it's a Gerrit refspec), and the ""Push to
Gerrit"" or ""Fetch Change from Gerrit"" dialogs have no last used URI
set, initialize it to the URI just configured. This gives a reasonable
initial value when those dialogs are subsequently opened the first time
for that repository.

With a default handler for this command, there are two quick access
entries: ""Rename Branch"" and ""Rename Branch..."". They are available at
all times, but the first one should have the ellipsis, and the second
one does not work (throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException) if the selection
is in an unexpected part.

* Change the command name for the org.eclipse.egit.ui.team.RenameBranch
  command to ""Rename Branch..."" so that it show correctly in quick
  access.
* Remove the defaultHandlers for the various renameBranch commands. Add
  explicit handlers with correct <activeWhen> expressions.
* Remove the unused org.eclipse.egit.ui.RepositoriesViewRenameBranch
  command from plugin.xml.
* Make the CommitGraphTable use the standard rename command, like the
  repositories view does.
* Delete unused class RenameBranchAction.
* Simplify AbstractHistoryCommandHandler a little bit.

As a result, there is only one ""Rename Branch..."" available in quick
access, and only if applicable. Moreover, the correct handler is invoked
if applicable. Context menus are unchanged in appearance and
functionality.

To fix bug 495064, one would have to do similar refactorings for all
other default handlers. (Unless, of course, for those that really make
sense as a default handler.)

The PasteCommand shows an alert to the user _and_ logs an error. That's
overkill here. Just showing an alert is good enough. Besides, it's not
really an error.

Even better would be to deactivate the handler when the clipboard
doesn't contain a git repo location. But I suspect a property tester for
this would be rather expensive, so I opted for this simpler solution.

Also add a missing clipboard.dispose() in the FetchGerritChangePage.

Doing so quite frequently led to UI deadlocks when modal dialogs were
active when the job's result dialog popped up. Instead use the progress
framework's mechanisms to give the user a possibility to open a job's
result dialog at his leisure. Thus there is no danger of conflicting
with any modal shells.

Push and fetch UI tests adapted to the new behavior.

When a bare repository is selected in the GitSelectRepositoryPage, the
import wizard throws and reports multiple NoWorkTreeExceptions.

Since a bare repository has no working tree, one cannot import from a
bare repository. Therefore, do not display bare repositories in the
GitSelectRepositoryPage at all. The user thus cannot select a bare
repository in the first place.

a certain convention is used for either the feature names or the commit
message, such as putting the ticket ID first. In the future, this could
be used to sort by the date of the last commit on a branch.

This class packed too many things into one, resulting in hard to
understand flow of control. Also, a class with different ""modes"" in
anathema to object-orientedness and to separation of concerns.

Eliminate the different modes from BranchOperationUI: they all just
defined which dialog to open initially, if any. Create those dialogs
instead in the few places when the static factory methods were used,
then use the BranchOperationUI to do the checkout, if appropriate.

Simplify RenameBranchDialog by re-using the BranchRenameDialog
:-) and by not checking for tags, which are not displayed anyway.

Make both the asynchronous (start()) and the synchronous (run())
checkout operations perform the the same actions, including project
restoration.

Factor out the checking for running launches so that it can be re-used
elsewhere.

Move the search widget into the toolbar

This necessitates being more careful with global action registrations.
These previously used updateActionBars(), which updates also the
toolbars, which messes up when the focus changes from the history page
to the search bar's text input: one needed two clicks to set the focus
on the search bar. Resolved by updating only the global menu manager
when we changed only global action handlers.

ToolbarManager has a number of problems correctly re-displaying a
changing toolbar with dynamic items. In particular, it is not sufficient
to only update the ToolbarManager. It is in this case necessary to use
updateActionBars() indeed, which does much more and manages to re-layout
and re-position the toolbar properly. However, it messes up with the
background of the Composite containing the ToolBar. This was worked
around by some ugly back-and-forth with the focus. Some more focus
juggling had to be done to get the history view (and thus its status
line manager) to activate when the focus was elsewhere and the user then
clicked directly into the search bar, thus focusing it.

The search result indicator (""1/n"") had to be moved out of the toolbar
itself. Instead there's now a listener interface that gets handed
that text and that then can display it as it sees fit. In this
implementation, it's simply written to the status bar. I also had
experimented with using a tooltip, but that becomes a hassle very
quickly. And tooltips belong to clan MacLeod: there can be only one.

With commit 09e0d369 we've eliminated asynchronous dialogs from
background jobs for pushing and fetching. Instead, we associate an
action to open the result dialog with the job; the user can invoke that
action from the progress view.

This works nicely, but makes it easy to overlook a failed push.

Try to improve that by making the job return an ERROR status when a
push failure has occurred. This makes the job/status framework notify
the user; the notification dialog will show the failure message and
additionally a button giving access to the job's action, which will
open the full push result dialog.

event, force a recalculation if the project directory no longer exists
(i.e., the project was also removed on disk).

* Use shorter labels for the up/down ToolItems: GTK scales all buttons
  to the same size, making the other buttons appear way too wide if a
  long label is used, and thus the whole toolbar required lots of
  horizontal space.
* Pack the toolbars. On GTK, this often (though not always!) fixes the
  mis-alignment of some labels, which appeared left-aligned instead of
  centered.
* Remove a useless SashForm with only one child, and remove some more
  dead UI code.
* Move both toolbars into the form header, one left-, the other right
  aligned. Remove the now pointless title bar from the plan section.
* Remove the background from the toolbars so the form header's gradient
  shows through.
* Calculate the width of the ""Commit Id"" column based on string extents
  to avoid the column header gets clipped.
  
The net result is a much sleaker and much more compact view that has
more space for the actual plan items. See the before-after screenshots
attached to the bug report.

Apparently there is some refresh of the viewer occurring while the test
is trying to expand a node hierarchy.

It's not entirely clear why this happens here, nor why the test was
waiting for jobs for at most 5 seconds. Let's try instead opening the
view before renaming the branch. Renaming the branch then should indeed
trigger a viewer refresh, which we can explicitly wait for.

* It used the real user config.
* It didn't clean up properly after tests, so that the user config
  contained left-overs from the test and accumulated more and more

Fix by cleaning once before all tests, and then after each test. Also
remove the ""testsection.testname"" test section. And finally, do not use
the real user config but a temporary file instead.

When the view automatically switched from list to compact tree mode
because there were too many nodes in the tree viewer and then some nodes
are removed such that it got below the limit, the switch back to list
mode occurred before the new input (with fewer nodes) had been set.

The switch back was also done by running the action, which refreshes
the viewer. As a result, the viewer then tried to display the old input
as a flat list, but that old input still had too many nodes.

Resolve by not running the action. Only update the presentation setting
and don't refresh; the subsequent setting of the input will cause a
refresh anyway, but then with the correct new input with fewer nodes.

This solves the case mentioned in [1]: a folder containing 50000 files,
visible (not expanded) in the staging view, then ignored: took several
minutes on GTK because the view then tried to display 50000+ files as a
flat list before setting the new input, which doesn't contain that huge
folder anymore.

Note that this change does not fix the other performance problems
mentioned in bug 500106.

Three problems:

1. Markers were displayed only on files and the direct parents if tree
   or compact tree layout was used, but not on folders higher up.
2. Marker changes were only accounted for if triggered by resource
   modifications. In that case, a new IndexDiff is calculated and the
   viewers get a completely new input, refreshing everything. Other
   marker changes, for instance deleting a marker in the problems view,
   were only reflected in the staging view in list mode.
3. Commit button enablement did not account for such marker changes
   (bug 499913).

Fixes:

1. In StagingFolderEntry use IResource.DEPTH_INFINITY instead of
   IResource.DEPTH_ONE.
2. The ProblemLabelDecorator only considered the root nodes of a tree
   viewer. Fix by also considering parent containers of changed
   resources, and when translating to viewer elements, descending into
   StagingFolderEntries that have marker changes.
3. ProblemLabelDecorator updated the affected viewer rows directly.
   Instead fire a LabelProviderChangedEvent. This also updates the
   affected viewer rows, but additionally makes it possible to listen
   to such events and update the commit buttons accordingly.

EGit creates a StagingEntry for each file that can appear in the staging
view. It creates all these objects up front, and each StagingEntry tries
immediately to determine the corresponding workspace IFile.

The latter is a rather expensive operation. When there are many
StagingEntries, this results in a potentially long delay before the
staging view populates, even if the tree or compact tree representation
is used and most of the files are in some not expanded folder and thus
not even visible.

By delaying finding the IFile until it's needed (which is when the file
actually is displayed in the staging view), the cost of this operation
is not incurred up front but only when nodes are expanded, and thus the
view populates much quicker initially.

If the list presentation is used, this change will not have any effect.

The staging view's label provider was derived from
DecoratingLabelProvider, which is an ITreePathLabelProvider. For these,
the TreeViewer's WrappedViewerLabelProvider computes the tree path for
each element, which then ultimately isn't used because the
StagingViewLabelProvider is _not_ an ITreePathLabelProvider. This tree
path computation is, at least on GTK, fairly expensive.

By not deriving our label provider from DecoratingLabelProvider but
wrapping it, we can ensure that the framework does not compute these
tree paths that are then not used anyway, and decorations are
significantly faster on GTK.

The context menu in the staging view could take _very_ long to appear on
a folder node with many children. This was caused by (a) the quadratic
algorithm using lists, and (b) by the frequent re-allocations occurring
in one of those lists.

Fix by collecting the staging entries in a linked hash set, which offers
faster membership testing and (for this use case) better memory
management. Only convert to a list (as required by the structured
selection used) once all staging entries have been collected.

The context menu now appears quickly, even on large folders. However,
applying actions may now still take very long. For instance, selecting
""Ignore"" on a (non-expanded) folder containing 50000 files tries to add
all those 50000 files one after the other to a .gitignore, which takes
ages. This is not fixed by this change; there is a long-standing TODO
for this in IgnoreOperation.

Adding files to .gitignore would take a lot of time if many files were
selected. Improve this by:

* grouping paths by folder,
* not checking each file individually for eligibility via
  RepositoryUtil.canBeAutoIgnored() but doing a batch check in a
  single tree walk for all files in a folder,
* not adding them one by one to the .gitignore file(s) but batch adding
  per folder.
* running the modifications in a WorkspaceJob to batch resource update
  events for .gitignore files in the workspace.

This makes it possible to even use the ""Ignore"" action in the staging
view on a (non-expanded) folder containing 50000 unstaged files. This
is now snappy.

The following IndexDiff recomputation is very slow, though. On my Mac
it takes about 40 seconds until the staging view and the decorations in
the package explorer update. This is not fixed by this change, and it's
unclear to me how this could be fixed. A .gitignore file with 50000
single-file entries slows down JGit tremendously because it will
process all those match rules for all files in that directory, which
gives quadratic behavior.

This change therefore also adds two measures to mitigate this:

* a warning dialog explaining this, giving the user a chance to back
  out. The threshold for this warning dialog to appear has been set
  somewhat arbitrarily at 500 files to be ignored.
* a new menu action ""Ignore Folders"" to ignore folders instead of the
  files contained in those folders. This action is only available if
  only folders are selected in the staging view.
  
With this new action, it's possible to ignore that huge folder also from
the staging view. Before, it could be ignored only via the Team->Ignore
context menu action in the package explorer.

Since commit aadbb158 in JGit, JGit does recognize these extra values.

Adapt the EGit UI (wizards & dialogs for branch creation, branch
configuration, pulling and pushing a branch) to provide a UI to let
the user select any valid BranchRebaseMode value. Introduce a new
BranchRebaseModeCombo for this.

Adapt UI tests.

The ModelAwareSyncStrategy consults the logical model providers to
determine the set of resources involved in synchronization operations

has an impact on some test cases where we now set-up the preference

once problems with creating this context menu declaratively (see bug

programmatically but relying on some declarations (including default
handlers) in plugin.xml. These default handlers can still be invoked
outside of their intended context, but cannot be removed easily. The
approach taken for now for this ShowBlameHandler is thus to at least
prevent exceptions when it is invoked when it shouldn't be:

* Prevent NPE in the ShowBlameHandler (history view).

Commit bc712de04 broke the handling of global actions. The git history
view has three viewers, each with their own actions (and context menus).
Each registered and unregistered global actions when it got or lost the
focus. This interfered badly with the new dynamic search toolbar item
because updateActionBars() also updates the toolbar and re-creates that
dynamic item every time. However, the change made in bc712de04 was not
correct; global action registrations were no longer propagated to the
RetargetActions.

This change refactors the whole action handling in these three viewers
in the git history view. There was too much code duplication anyway.

* Factor out the creation of global actions into new class ActionUtils.
* Make the viewers only provide the actions, but not register/unregister
  them.
* The view itself is not responsible for action registration.
* Introduce a new GlobalActionHandler. This tracks registers actions
  once, tracks focus changes among the viewers, and makes the registered
  actions delegate to the actions provided by the currently focused
  viewer.

This gets rid of the focus change listeners in the three viewers, and
also avoids having to call updateActionBars() on each focus change.

This menu command makes sense only for staged files, but it was enabled
wrongly also on unstaged files. Apparently that was done on purpose in
commit 6d975be6 to avoid a costly index diff calculation to find out
whether the file was staged.

But if we are able to display ""staged"" decorations speedily, we
certainly are also able to determine quickly whether a file is staged.
Make isEnabled() properly check again, using the same mechanisms we use
for decorations, which rely on the IndexDiffCache. Remove the extra
check when the command is run, including the dialog.

The context menu was missing from editors opened from the history
view's file list (Context menu->Show Revision Information would
open an editor and show the annotations, but when these were then
hidden, they could not be re-displayed from within the editor).
Moreover, opening a file version from the history view (Context
menu->Open This Version) would open an editor that would have the
""Show Revision Information"" context menu, but when invoked it would
open up yet another editor.

The root cause is explained in bug 505938, comment 2. Basically we
end up with different FileRevisionEditorInput classes being used for
editors, one from EGit, and an internal one from org.eclipse.ui.team.

Fix this by refactoring the blame machinery in EGit UI to work either
with IFile or with CommitFileRevision. and make sure to use
EgitEditorUtils.openEditor() instead of
RevisionAnnotationController.openEditor().

Replace the old-style <objectContribution> to org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus

commands, and the now unused legacy actions. Re-order the commands as
they were.

There should be no functional or visual change except that the commands
are hidden completely when not enabled (as opposed to being visible but
disabled).

The four commands had to be handled in one change to preserve the oder
in which they appear in the sub-menu. Doing this one by one would lead
to intermediary states where the order was different.

* CompareIndexWithHead: activate the handler on a single selection for
  which hasStagedChanges() is true. Hide it when not enabled. Make the
  ResourceStatePropertyTester also work for items that adapt
  only to IPath but not to IResource, like StagingEntry, otherwise
  the new <handler> definition would not be active for those, which
  would have broken the comparison on a staged file (double click) in
  the staging view. Remove the now unused CompareIndexWithHeadAction,
  and the alwaysCheckEnabled() work-around.
  
* CompareWithPrevious: activate handler only if the selection indeed
  has tracked resources. Formerly, the command was enabled for
  untracked resources, but then presented a dialog that it couldn't
  find any previous version. Add a new property ""hasTrackedResources""
  to the ResourceStatePropertyTester.
  
* CompareWithIndex: de-activate the handler if there are only ignored
  resources in the selection. The command works in that case, too, but
  simply presented an empty comparison in that case, which is a bit
  pointless.

Drag&drop offers a FileTransfer, but considered only StagingEntries.
If only StagingFolderEntries were selected, the resulting FileTransfer
would be empty, which is not allowed and produces a SWTException,
making the drag&drop fail.

This is especially devastating on GTK, where the FileTransfer sometimes
gets created up front, and thus even drags between our own two viewers
failed frequently. On Mac, the FileTransfer is created lazily when
hovering over an item (such as a Finder window) that accepts such
transfers, and the problem thus went largely unnoticed there.

Try to alleviate this by also considering folders and including the
staged or unstaged files contained in those folders when creating a
FileTransfer. This is still not a complete solution; transfers may
still fail if the selection includes only deleted files. A complete
solution is only possible by removing support for FileTransfer
completely. Which might make sense anyway: a plain drag&drop (no
modifier keys pressed) from the staging view to a Finder window on my
Mac results in a move, and the original file is consequently removed,
resulting in very surprising behavior: a staged file suddenly appears
as an unstaged deletion!

Also reduce code duplication by factoring out the creation of the
staged and unstaged viewers into a common method.

Additionally, ensure that dropping onto the same staged or unstaged
viewer the drag&drop initially started from is a no-op; otherwise this
did inadvertently stage/unstage other files contained in selected
folders.

problem. Remove that adapter definition completely for now. It was
introduced as part of a change that made the history view react on
working set selections, but for that, the adapter definition for
IWorkingSet is sufficient.

I'll have to re-visit this later to see more precisely if there's a
simple way to have this adapter definition without running into an
endless recursion.

The reference field was auto-filled with the name of the currently
checked out local branch. This doesn't make sense since there is no
guarantee that a branch with the same name exists upstream. Checking if
this is the case would be too slow since it involves a remote request.
Hence leave the reference field empty, the user can use content assist
to find candidate upstream references.

The oomph setup doesn't set a workspace encoding, therefore using the
platform default for all projects without explicit project setting (like
the github connector project).

Since the POM files use utf8 encoding as Maven arguments it seems
reasonable to have the complete workspace use this encoding.

The change includes a relative move of another existing workspace
preference. This is because of using the oomph preference capturing and
will not occur anymore for further captured preferences.

This regression was introduced with the fix for bug 440097. That one
removed the line ""setMessage(null)"". This fix reintroduces that line,
but as ""setMessage(initialMessageWhenThePageWasCreated)"" instead. This
avoids the previously experienced wrong height calculation of the

Turns out that the replacement wasn't good; IDE.openEditor returns the
MultiPageEditorPart, not the nested AbstractDecoratedTextEditor.

Re-introduce RevisionAnnotationController for the IFile case, use our
own utils only for the IFileRevision case, and do handle multi-page
editors explicitly in that case.

Fix comment in ResourceStatePropertyTester: since commit 2349a197 it
doesn't enforce the ""single repository"" condition anymore to allow ""Add
to Index""/""Remove from Index"" to work for multiple repositories at once.

Since the ""Compare with"" handlers must also be enabled on StagingEntries
that do not adapt to IResource (such as staged files not in the
workspace) and the ""resourcesSingleRepository"" property thus cannot be
used, introduce a new ""selectionSingleRepository"" property test in the
SelectionPropertyTester and use that.

Visual change: the ordering of the compare actions on a WorkingSet is
now consistent with the ordering on IResources. Previously and
inexplicably, the order was different.

Restrict the ""Replace with Previous"" to tracked resources; on untracked

no previous revision. Which is correct, but then why allow trying to

Visual change: previously, ""Replace with HEAD"" and ""Replace With Index""

The find toolbar widget of the history view does some ugly focus
juggling. Make sure to do this only initially, or when the widget is
explicitly shown by the user triggering the findToolbarAction, but not
when the control is re-created in response to other events, such as
switching between history pages.

This focus back-and-forth is a hack, but unfortunately it's the only
way I have found to fix the wrong background of the whole toolbar when
showing the find widget makes the toolbar move from right of the tabs
to below the tabs.

Provide links on file headlines and hunk headers to open files in
editors.

Provides links to:
* Open the previous version in an editor
* Open the workspace version (if it exists) in an editor
* Open ""this"" version (i.e., the “current” one of the diff) in an
  editor
* Open a two-way diff between the previous and this version in a
  compare editor

Hyperlinks were chosen instead of a context menu because:
* A context menu sensitive to the location in the text would have
  needed to be based on the location of the current selection, which
  is cumbersome.
* A context menu based on click coordinates is not a good idea because
  * one has no immediate access to the coordinates of the mouse event
    triggering the context menu (and if one had, it would need to be 
    converted to a text location), and
  * when the context menu is triggered via the keyboard (Shift-F10),
    there is no reasonable coordinate to use anyway.

Add a hyperlink detector to create links to open files (and reveal the
affected lines if on a hunk).

As it turned out, simply adding a hyperlink detector worked already,
but had a few problems:
* Background and foreground colors got messed up when mousing over
  the hyperlinks because the JFace hyperlink infrastructure didn’t
  interact well with the purely SWT-based coloring done in the viewer.
* The hyperlink pop-up giving access to the different open ""commands""
  when there are multiple hyperlinks at the same location took longer
  to appear the further down in the diff the hyperlink was. No idea
  why; the hyperlink detector itself is fast.

Therefore rewrite the DiffViewer to use the JFace infrastructure for
syntax coloring. The hand-crafted SWT coloring is a dead-end and makes
adding new features very hard.

Added a document partitioner, plus a presentation reconciler. The line
background listener was kept to get backgrounds extending over the
whole width of the viewer (syntax coloring alone would only set the
background on actual content).

This solves the color problems, and interestingly also makes the
hyperlink pop-ups appear speedily, even at the bottom of a lengthy
diff.

Also move all the ""open file (version)"" methods to DiffViewer and use
them in StagingView, CommitFileDiffViewer, and CompareTreeView instead
of duplicating code all around.

This enables many standard text editor actions like ""Find"" or
""Go to line"".

There should be no visual changes except:
* The diff page behaves generally like a real read-only text editor,
  including global contributions to menus, toolbars, the status line,
  and so on. The line number ruler is now provided by the text editor
  and can be toggled. And if the diff show multiple files, there's even
  folding.
* The context menu is now a standard extensible text editor context
  menu that may get contributions. In my tests, it does get a ""Show
  In..."" sub-menu that shows ""<No applicable views>"". It also provides
  access to the text editor preferences.

Code changes:

* DiffViewer simplified. In particular removed a number of things from
  the constructor that are now provided by the standard text editor
  framework. (Line numbers, highlighting current line, configuration).
* CommitEditor: give it an IEditorActionBarContributor to manage
  contributions of nested text editors.
* Make HyperlinkSourceViewer a ProjectionViewer to get folding support
  in the editor.
* Rewrite DiffEditorPage to be a TextEditor.

When attempting to fetch a Gerrit patch set which the user has already
fetched they are now presented with an option to change to the already
fetched branch. This is the default option if a local branch exists. If
no local branch exists for a ref this option is not available.

FormPage by default re-sets the focus to the first child of the

it'll always set focus on the author indication. Add focus tracking
to identify the control currently having the focus so that it can
be re-focused when the page becomes active again after a page
change or editor de-activation.

JGit cannot compute meaningful diffs for merge commits. Display a
message saying so in the DiffEditorPage instead of throwing an NPE
(which would get caught, logged, and reported to the user in an error

The alternative would have been to not add a DiffEditorPage at all for
merge commits, but I considered that confusing. Users would be left
wondering why for some commits no diff page was present.

EGit 4.5 removed the immediate result dialogs for ""Fetch"" and
""Push"" to avoid UI deadlocks that were reported quite frequently
and replaced them with an action that could be invoked explicitly
by the user via the progress view. That side-stepped the UI
deadlock problem, but sometimes these dialogs show useful
information that one would like to see immediately, such as
the Gerrit URL after a successful push to Gerrit.

This commit brings back those ""immediate"" dialogs. They're not
quite as immediate as they used to be, though: they are delayed
until there are no modal shells open anymore. That will still
avoid UI deadlocks, and will make the dialogs appear as soon as
it's safe to do so and as soon as the user can do something useful
with them.

Additionally, this commit resurrects and completes an old
""work-in-progress"" commit[1] that added preferences to optionally
hide those dialogs if the user so wishes. Hiding the dialogs
falls back to the action mechanism introduced in EGit 4.5; the
dialogs are then still accessible via the progress view.

* Add a method to delay showing the result until there are no modal
  shells.
* Add preferences to hide the dialogs, including UI in the preference
  pages.
* Adapt the result reporting mechanism to use both

Note that this commit only adds preferences for the push and fetch
cases; pull is a different implementation altogether.

Use SubMonitor consistently. Make sure that the same monitor is not
passed on to two different operations: in such cases, the first may
consume all available ticks. Instead pass each operation their own
child monitor.

Refactor the EclipseGitProgressTransformer to use SubMonitor instead
of the deprecated SubProgressMonitor. This is now a simple infinite
progress implementation that gives a little nicer visual feedback.

For instance for a clone operation, the old implementation would
always have consumed all ticks after the ""Receiving Objects"" step,
and the progress bar could thus no longer advance during ""Resolving
Deltas"" and ""Updating References"", nor even later during the post-
clone tasks. With the new implementation, the progress bar advances
properly through all tasks.

Provide dedicated handlers with appropriate activeWhen clauses

The remaining default handler for org.eclipse.egit.ui.commit.Checkout
cannot be removed (yet). The command is used for the checkout button
in the CommitEditor's toolbar. This is in the header of a
SharedHeaderFormEditor, and the usual technique for eliminating
default handlers doesn't work in that case: the button always
remains disabled. Something strange with the site or the selection
provider is going on, or these toolbar buttons need some more
hook-up, but I don't see what's missing.

Rewrite the new branch name normalization to not interfere with the
user's typing. Instead just replace blanks by underscores. Use the
content assist framework to suggest an auto-corrected branch name if
the current input does not form a valid branch name. Show content
assist availability via the normal lightbulb decorator.

This content-assist can be triggered via the normal keystroke. On
characters that are known to be rejected by JGit in any case, it is
also triggered automatically. If the current input _does_ form a
valid branch name, content assist is disabled and the lightbulb is
hidden.

This gives the user full control over the input, but provides easily
accessible auto-correction suggestions.

I recently noticed that auto completion for branch names (e.g. in the
push branch wizard) lists them in a non recognizable order. This changes
the content assist list to be sorted by name, similarly like branches
are already sorted by name in tree views.

I have not run UI tests for this change, since local egit tests
generally tend to be red, even on origin/master.

Add null checks. Also normalize again in egit.mylyn if we cut after
30 characters: if we're unlucky, the substring might end with a slash
or a period, and JGit likes neither.

There is no verb ""to checkout"" in English. If there was, we could

""to check out"", a file has been ""checked out"", and ""checking out"" a
branch might fail.

Make the ToggleBranchCommit and the ToggleBranchHierarchy commands
work also when invoked (for instance via Quick Access) when the
currently active view is not the repositories view.

These two commands use default handlers; when invoked via Quick
Access for instance when the Outline view was the active view,
they would produce an ExecutionException since no active view
could be determined. The commands would thus execute halfway
through: they'd update the command's state, but then fail and
instead of refreshing the view would pop up an error dialog.

I see no reason to restrict those two commands to be available
only when the repositories view is the active view. So instead
of eliminating the default handler, change the implementation
such that the commands work in any case.

SWTbot was changed today to do selections in trees differently, and
also to do event notification differently.[1] This makes these tests
fail consistently because evidently the command enablement has not
been recomputed yet when we test it, and command.isHandled() is still
false. It's a timing issue; running in the debugger the tests can be
made to succeed.

With [1], SWTbot sends event notifications inside an asyncExec.
Previously, it sent them outside. I don't know if our test was broken
all along and succeeded just by chance, or whether [1] introduced a
bug in SWTbot. In any case selecting the the tree node inside a
Display.syncExec() ensures that the selection is done and event
notifications have occurred before the test proceeds.

Perform the underlying git ls-remote command used to fetch the
refs for the content assist on the ""Change"" field in the background.

A normal WizardDialog does not support this; its run() method always
disables the dialog and uses a ModalContext to run the Runnable.

Therefore, extend WizardDialog to really run Runnables in the
background if fork == true. The dialog remains active while the job
is running. Background jobs are canceled if the dialog is closed (or
the wizard page is changed) before they have terminated.

Rewrite the FetchGerritChangePage to take that into account.
Implement ChangeLists as Futures; pre-fetch them to minimize the
perceived waiting time for the user when content assist is invoked,
and rewrite the content proposal provider to use these futures. If
not completed yet, return null (no proposals, and no beep either),
but once available and the uri is still the same, do pop up the
proposals if the focus is still in the Change field.

There are actually two new layers of jobs in this implementation.
First the BackgroundJobs in the new NonBlockingWizardDialog. Those
take care of performing some true background work while still being
able to report progress through the wizard's progress monitor in the
UI. Second, the jobs used by the ChangeList futures. Those have three
purposes:
* They enable pre-fetching.
* They encapsulate the logic of starting and canceling jobs
* The de-coupling makes it possible to cancel the BackgroundJob
  visible in the UI while still keeping on getting the result so
  that it will be available in the future if content assist is
  invoked again.

Because it is now possible to enter a branch name while the content
proposal is in progress, only update the branch (and tag) name if
the user did not edit it or if it is empty. (That already occurred
before this change, but probably rarely since people typically fill
out the dialog from the top: enter change number, invoke content
assist, select patch set, then perhaps go edit the suggested branch
name. With asynchronous content assist and the dialog not blocked,
the sequence enter change number, invoke content assist (may take
a while, especially the first time), enter branch name, invoke content
assist again, select patch set is more likely to occur making this
overwriting of a user-supplied branch name more of a noticeable
nuisance.)

Overall I find:
* The pre-fetch does reduce the time for the first content assist in
  many cases. It doesn't help much if the clipboard contains content
  we use to auto-fill the Change field and invoke the content assist
  directly.
* The dialog not being blocked, the time spent fetching the refs can
  be used to enter the branch name already.
* The new background jobs make it possible to cancel the dialog when
  fetching the refs takes long and is still in progress. Previously,
  one had to wait until that was done, and it couldn't be canceled
  either.
  
Note that the FetchGerritChangePage also still works when run inside
a normal WizardDialog that does not support background operations.
This is a service to the Egerrit project; they use this (EGit-
internal!) wizard. The only benefit is then the pre-fetch.

This progress monitor updated its SubMonitor every time if

that optimizes for this, but on Neon and earlier Eclipses,
this progress reporting may slow down operations. Most noticeably
it occurred in the ""counting objects"" phase of a push operation,
which would become unuseably slow if run in the foreground, but
which would terminate quickly when run in the background.

The button would show disabled when the editor was not active. That's
correct. But when clicked, editor activation would occur first, and
then the command was executed. The net user-visible effect was that
we had a ""disabled"" button in the UI that was armed and would perform
a command all the same.

That's not good. Resolve similar to the PDE ManifestEditor's launch
bar actions: show them always as enabled. This is achieved by not
contributing the commands directly to the toolbar but using an
intermediary action.

Also use only the current selection in the handler's activation
expression.

Provide dedicated handlers with an appropriate activation expression
instead. The commands work for one or several RepositoryCommits. The
expression must not refer to the active part since these commands can
be invoked from either the CommitEditor or the GitHistoryPage.

In the CommitEditor, use intermediary actions for the toolbar
contributions to avoid enablement problems (see bug 516679).

SVG source are included in the repository under the ./icons top-level
directory.

* Copy SVG source files from eclipse.platform.images where applicable
* Replace GIFs by PNGs
* Provide HiDPI icons

Adapt references where needed (plugin.xml and UIIcons.java). Copied
SVGs include a comment where they come from.

All EGit icons have been re-done in SVG. Differences in the generated
pixel maps are minimal.

Some basic components are under ./icons/components.

The old GIF and PNG icons have all been replaced by newly generated
PNGs and all have HiDPI (""@2x"") versions.

Wherever possible use components from existing platform icons
already available; this not only simplifies icon creation but
also makes it easier to conform to the color scheme used in
platform. This has resulted in a few minor changes where the old
gif icons did not match the new SVGs from platform. An example are
icons containing a ""file"" object, for instance the reflog view icon:
the old gif showed a dog-ear in the bottom-right corner of the ""page"",
while current platform SVGs show a dog-ear top-right. The wizard
banner images, being larger, show more pixel-level differences. That
was to be expected since they were all re-done from scratch using
the current platform wizard banner styles.

Icon etool16/annotate.png should be changed. It's the icon for the
""Show Revision Information"" command, which was formerly named ""Show
Annotations"". With the new name, an icon symbolizing a note doesn't
make sense anymore.

Due to bug 465456 we have to keep around all GIFs used as editor
or view icons, otherwise users may experience FileNotFoundExceptions
when starting on an old workspace because E4 stores icon URIs in
workbench.xmi. This concerns:

* eview16/rebase_interactive.gif
* eview16/reflog.gif
* eview16/repo_rep.gif
* obj16/changelog_obj.gif
* obj16/gitrepository.gif

These GIF files have been re-created; they are identical to the
new PNGs created from the SVG sources. Otherwise users might wonder
why they sometimes get different icons for the same thing.

If there are selected elements in the staged/unstaged viewers,
provide quick access to the ""Add to index""/""Remove from index""
actions via a toolbar shown in a tooltip when the mouse pointer
hovers over a selected element.

Also add those actions to the toolbars of the viewers, properly
enabled/disabled depending on whether there is a selection in
the viewer.

Change the unstage icon: ""stage"" is a green plus sign, but ""unstage""
was an inverted ""reset"" icon. A red minus sign seems to be more
appropriate and less confusing.

Finally, add tooltips to the section headers of the staged and
unstaged viewers with explanations that should make it easier
for people new to git to get what this whole view is about.
(The notion of being able to compose a commit in the git way is
a novelty for many people new to git.)

We might consider making Oomph also install TPD as it is needed to

which I personally always install; if only to get rid of trailing
whitespace in plugin.xml files automatically :-)

Tested by using the Neon Installer, ""Eclipse IDE for Eclipse

(green plus sign top right), then installing and launching a brand-new
Eclipse instance through the Installer.

On GTK at least, the artificial inset of 5 pixels used in the
tooltip's internal TooltipHideListener closes the tooltip before
the mouse ever can move over the tooltip. It appears that on GTK
the tooltip's shell gets an SWT.MouseExit event with coordinates
inside the tooltip, but not within the smaller inset area.

It's utterly unclear to me why this inset was ever programmed anyway.
Removing it and always testing against the true bounds of the tooltip
resolves the problem and makes it possible to move the mouse cursor
over the tooltip, also on GTK.

The behavior on MacOS is unchanged.

The buttons do not appear in the contextual action tooltip. The
contextual actions operate on a selection, whereas the new

Including it in the tooltip would give a confusing UI.

Also, if this action were in the tooltip, a slight mis-click would
stage/unstage not only the selected files but all of them. Although
that would not be a severe problem (the changed files are selected
after the operation in the target viewer, so undoing a ""stage all""
is as easy as using ""unstage seleted files""), let's try to avoid this.

The folder handling in the git ""Team synchonization"" support was wrong
since commit f46237a (bug 516426). That commit considered folders as
supervised -- which is correct since otherwise some changes may be
missed. It also tried to compensate for folders without changes showing
up in the synchronize view by setting their sync state to IN_SYNC if
they had only IN_SYNC descendants.

That broke the display of ""compacted folders"" in the synchronize view.
If a file is not IN_SYNC, the synchronize view is able to handle its
parent containers fine without needing any SyncInfo for them. When we
do supply sync info, the parent containers will be considered changed
themselves, and will show up explicitly in the synchronize view.

Therefore, simply return IN_SYNC for folders. The state recorded in the
GitSyncObjCache is bogus anyway.

The history view would sometimes not show the full commit data of a
selected commit but only the first line containing the commit ID.

I finally had a simple reproducible situation, and after spending some
hours debugging our commit parsing and message text formatting without
finding any problem, I finally had the idea to check the viewer itself
and gave is a cyan background. And lo and behold: the viewer was not
resized properly.

So the message text was there all along, but was not shown because the
viewer was too small and showed only the first line!

Fix by forcing a layout of the viewers on text changes.

Also recompute the size when the diff viewer becomes empty.

_not_ need to be aware of any listeners anywhere that might update UI:
reacting to preference changes in the correct thread is clearly the

stateless. Use a singleton instance instead.

Also use a singleton instance ResourceState for ignored resources. For
such resources:

* we're not interested in any of the other properties,
* the default values of the other properties are fine.

While these allocations are not the cause of the slowness of updating
decorations, they add unnecessary overhead, memory usage, and pressure
on the garbage collector.

Per bug 226343 the DeferredTreeContentManager has some problems.
Avoid most of them by serializing jobs asynchronously loading the
reflog, and once we have the reflog, don't re-load it but return
it directly.

Fix auto-updates of the view by re-setting the input on ref changes.
Just calling refresh() doesn't work anymore if the reflog is loaded
asynchronously.

Set the shell's minimum size to the size needed to display the

access to egit internal packages in the same manner that other egit
bundles allow this, since incompatible changes will immediately lead to
compile errors.

The change only adds x-friends for actually existing discouraged access
warnings from *.github.* to *.egit.* (somewhat more than 100 warnings,
that are now gone). It does not fix any other discouraged access to

Our command/action/handler architecture suffers from lots of
duplication. Basically each view has its own set of commands and
its own set of handlers that often end up doing similar things.
There are a few general commands at org.eclipse.ui.internal.commit,
but even those end up being duplicated in history.

This is all unnecessarily complicated, verbose, error-prone, and
honestly said, unmaintainable.

Let's start to clean this up by introducing common interfaces that
describe the logical objects. These interfaces can then be used in
plugin.xml in activation handlers, and handlers can be written against
selections of such objects. That will enable us to provide a single
set of commands for, say, RevCommits. If needed, these commands can
have different handlers with different activations.

The history view's main context menu was built programmatically,
apparently because of bug 322751, which undid an earlier attempt
to do this (bug 321516).

Move the context menu back to plugin.xml. Remove the menu items from
CommitGraphTable and add a new section in the menu (""history.group"")
so that we can add our built-in commands in our own group, not just
under ""additions"".

Basically all the history view commands had defaultHandlers. To
remove them, we need quite a lot of new dedicated handlers.

Verified that the error described in bug 322751 did not re-appear.

There should be only minor visual changes in the context menu of the
history view. We only show applicable operations, and I have slightly
re-arranged a few separators.

There is quite some duplication between handlers. With the new
IRepositoryCommit interface, it should be possible to unify many
commands, but this is postponed to future commits.

A double click on a plan item already opened the commit in the commit
viewer. Now add the corresponding action to the view's context menu
so that this functionality is easier to discover.

This also is a nice example of how the new IRepositoryCommit interface
simplifies command management: we just define a new menu contribution
for that context menu, *re-using* the existing handler from the
history view. The new contribution uses its own label since the
accelerator is changed.

Adapt the visibleWhen expressions of the rebase sub-menu items for
the ""Team"" sub-menu to avoid they appear in the rebase interactive
view.

Moving the existing handler from the ""internal.history"" package to a
more general place is for now left for a future clean-up commit, as
are more handler unifications and eventually unifying all these
""AbstractXYZHandler"" classes that all offer operations to get a
repository and commits from a selection, but that all do it in
slightly different and sometimes even view-specific ways.

or even in JGit (lib.TagBuilder, api.CommitCommand).

It is very easy to copy an SHA1 including some whitespace into the
search field, as I accidentally did today. Therefore trimming seems
useful here.

We could restrict the trimming to SHA1 search (instead of all types of
searches) if committers feel that it is an important use case to be able
to search for terms starting/ending with whitespace.

The search widget in the page's toolbar must _not_ honor changes
to the JFace dialog font. Otherwise the field becomes unusable
when the user increases the font size.

The problem has several causes, all beyond the control of EGit:

* Bug 521401: at least on Mac, the Text widget itself does not
  adjust its height when the font size changes.
* Bug 183003: even if it did, the Toolbar it is contained in
  does not properly respect the height of ControlContributions
  and would thus not adjust.
* Even if both were true, I'm not sure the CTabFolder containing
  the history view and thus that toolbar would deal properly with
  a toolbar that was higher than the tab height.
  
So it's best to simply use the default font. Font size changes in
the preferences will be ignored, but at least the field will remain
useable.

This reverts commit f5264cfabfb2f921304536f4471bff469d9ba546. The
repository, if available, provides additional context for running
the ls-remote operation, such as http.* configuration settings in
the repository config. Thus when we do have a repository, we should
use it.

Keep the good bits from commit f5264cf: add a new constructor to
ListRemoteOperation that can work without repository, and use it
in SourceBranchPage instead of creating an empty dummy repository
(which may fail) there. Same in LocalRepositoryTestCase.

Additionally remove the now unused message about not being able to
create a temporary repository.

When a ProjectRecord has no ProjectDescription, this indicates that
an error occurred while trying to read the .project file. EGit in that
case tried to be smart about it and to supply a new ProjectDescription,
but that only lead to follow-up errors.

Instead ignore such ProjectRecords completely. The platform will
already have logged an error about it (and we can't do anything about
that), but at least we can avoid even considering such projects for
import.

In case some such ProjectRecord should still get to
ProjectUtils.createExistingProject(), log an error with the offending
file path, but otherwise just don't do anything.

The handler activation in plugin.xml looks correct: the handler is
activated for RefNode, TagNode, FileNode, and StashedCommitNode.

The implementation in RepositoriesView tries to execute the command
only for those.

The only explanation for the handler not being active I have is that
somehow the selection gets lost somewhere... So make sure we pass on
the selected element and run the command explicitly with that element
as its current selection.

Copy the SVG and PNGs from the eclipse.platform.images git repository
and rename them from ""trash.*"" to ""trash_flat.*"".

Add a version check for the first version of the ""org.eclipse.ui""
bundle that uses the new icon to decide which one to use in EGit.
EGit UI has a hard (non-optional) dependency on org.eclipse.ui anyway,
so this version check is acceptable.

This ensures that EGit uses a trash icon visually identical to the
one used by the platform on which EGit runs, and thus the user is
presented with a consistent UI.

According to the documentation,[1] one form of the output of Gerrit's
""gerrit-version"" ssh command is ""<tagname>-<n>-g<sha1>"", where <sha1>
is defined by the documentation as ""the seven-character abbreviated
SHA-1 of the commit.""

Well, current Gerrit Gerrit reports at the bottom of that very same
documentation page at [1] its version as ""2.15-rc1-577-g6b1fed0abe"",
which is a 10-character abbreviated SHA1.

So relax the version check to match 7 or more characters.

(Such a long commit comment for adding a single comma!)

If a commit contains a big number of files, then the commit viewer diff
list cannot be scrolled down to see more than the very first files. This
seems to be caused by the section widget, which automatically sizes the
file list to contain every item.

By providing a size hint, the section no longer expands to contain all
items, but only consumes the available space of the editor.

The CompareActionsTest uses the synchronize view and expects the
resource model to be active. Other tests may have changed that
setting, though, and then these tests may fail.

Therefore set the active model provider explicitly. All tests using
the synchronize view must set the expected model provider(s).
